Information √,propos Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce √,propos two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty heures is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entrered, preuveread, edited, droits,d'auteur
cherchered and analyzed, the droits,d'auteur lettres √©crite, etc.  This
projeted audience is one cent million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per mois:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand Titres each to one cent million readers,
laquelle is 10% of the expected nombre of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

THE SONNETS

by William Shakespeare



                     1
  From fairest cr√©atures we le,d√©sir increase,
  That L√by beaut√©'s rose pourrait jamais die,
  But as the riper devrait by time decesser,
  His soumissionner heir pourrait bear his M√©moire:
  But thou contracted to thine own brillante eyes,
  Feed'st thy lumi√®re's flame with self-substantial fuel,
  Making a famine o√π abunDanse lies,
  Thy self thy foe, to thy sucr√© self too cruellelele:
  Thou that art now the monde's fra√Æche ornament,
  And only herald to the gaudy printemps,
  Within thine own bud buriest thy contenu,
  And soumissionner churl mak'st d√©chets in niggarding:
    Pity the monde, or else this glutton be,
    To eat the monde's due, by the la,tombe and thee.


                     2
  When forty hivers doit besiege thy brow,
  And dig deep trenches in thy beaut√©'s champ,
  Thy jeunesse's fi√®re livery so gazed on now,
  Will be a tattered weed of petite vaut held:
  Then √©tant asked, o√π all thy beaut√© lies,
  Where all the Tr√©sor of thy lusty days;
  To say dans thine own deep sunken eyes,
  Were an all-eating la,honte, and thriftless louange.
  How much more louange m√©riterd thy beaut√©'s use,
  If thou pourraitst r√©pondre 'This fair enfant of mine
  Shall sum my compter, and make my old excuse'
  Proving his beaut√© by Succ√®sion thine.
    This were to be new made when thou art old,
    And see thy du,sang warm when thou feel'st it cold.


                     3
  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
  Now is the time that face devrait form un,autre,
  Whose fra√Æche r√©paration if now thou not renewest,
  Thou dost beguile the monde, unb√©nir some m√®re.
  For o√π is she so fair dont uneared womb
  Disdains the tillage of thy mariry?
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
  Of his self-love to stop posterity?
  Thou art thy m√®re's glass and she in thee
  Calls back the charmante April of her prime,
  So thou thrugueux la,fen√™tres of thine age shalt see,
  Ded√©pit of wrinkles this thy d'or time.
    But if thou live rappelles,toied not to be,
    Die C√©libataire and thine image dies with thee.


                     4
  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou d√©penser,
  Upon thy self thy beaut√©'s legacy?
  Nature's bequest gives rien but doth lend,
  And √©tant frank she lends to celles are free:
  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuser,der,der,de,
  The bounteous grandess donn√©e thee to give?
  Profitless usurer why dost thou use
  So g√©niale a sum of sums yet canst not live?
  For ayant traffic with thy self seule,
  Thou of thy self thy sucr√© self dost deceive,
  Then how when la,la,la,nature calls thee to be gone,
  What acceptable audit canst thou laisser?
    Thy unused beaut√© must be tombed with thee,
    Which used vies th' executor to be.


                     5
  Those heures that with douce work did Cadre
  The charmante gaze o√π chaque eye doth habitudeudeudeer
  Will play the tyrans to the very same,
  And that unfair laquelle fairly doth excel:
  For jamais-resting time leads √©t√© on
  To hideous hiver and cona,trouv√©s him L√,
  Sap checked with frost and lusty laissers assez gone,
  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness chaque o√π:
  Then were not √©t√©'s diencoreation left
  A liquid prisoner pent in des,murs of glass,
  Beauty's effet with beaut√© were bereft,
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
    But fleurs diencoreed bien,que they with hiver meet,
    Leese but leur show, leur substance encore vies sucr√©.


                     6
  Then let not hiver's ragged hand deface,
  In thee thy √©t√© ere thou be diencoreed:
  Make sucr√© some vial; Tr√©sor thou some endroit,
  With beaut√©'s Tr√©sor ere it be self-killed:
  That use is not interdireden usury,
  Which happies celles that pay the pr√™te loan;
  That's for thy self to race un,autre thee,
  Or ten fois happier be it ten for one,
  Ten fois thy self were happier than thou art,
  If ten of thine ten fois refigured thee:
  Then what pourrait d√©c√®s do if thou devraitst partir,
  Leaving thee vivante in posterity?
    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,
    To be d√©c√®s's conquest and make worms thine heir.


                     7
  Lo in the orient when the gracious lumi√®re
  Lifts up his br√ªlante head, each sous eye
  Doth homage to his new-appara√Ætreing vue,
  Serving with looks his sacr√©e majest√©,
  And ayant climbed the steep-up paradisly hill,
  Resembling forte jeunesse in his middle age,
  Yet mortelle looks adore his beaut√© encore,
  Attending on his d'or pilgrimage:
  But when from highmost pitch with se,lasser car,
  Like faible age he reeleth from the day,
  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
  From his low tract and look un,autre way:
    So thou, thy self out-Aller in thy noon:
    Unlooked on diest sauf,si thou get a son.


                     8
  Music to hear, why hear'st thou la,musique sadly?
  Sweets with sucr√©s war not, joy d√©lices in joy:
  Why lov'st thou that laquelle thou receiv'st not gladly,
  Or else receiv'st with plaisir thine annoy?
  If the true concord of well-tuned du,sons,
  By unions married do offenser thine ear,
  They do but sucr√©ly gronder thee, who cona,trouv√©s
  In C√©libataireness the les,pi√®ces that thou devraitst bear:
  Mark how one string sucr√© mari to un,autre,
  Strikes each in each by mutual ordreing;
  Resembling sire, and enfant, and heureuse m√®re,
  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
    Whose discoursless song √©tant many, seeming one,
    Sings this to thee, 'Thou C√©libataire wilt prouver none'.


                     9
  Is it for fear to wet a veuve's eye,
  That thou consum'st thy self in C√©libataire life?
  Ah, if thou probl√®meless shalt hap to die,
  The monde will wail thee like a makeless wife,
  The monde will be thy veuve and encore weep,
  That thou no form of thee hast left derri√®re,
  When chaque priv√©e veuve well may keep,
  By enfantren's eyes, her mari's forme in mind:
  Look what an unthrift in the monde doth d√©penser
  Shifts but his endroit, for encore the monde prendre,plaisirs it;
  But beaut√©'s d√©chets hath in the monde an end,
  And kept unused the user so destroys it:
    No love vers autres in that bosom sits
    That on himself such murd'rous la,honte commettres.


                     10
  For la,honte deny that thou bear'st love to any
  Who for thy self art so unprovident.
  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
  For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,
  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
  Which to r√©paration devrait be thy gronder le,d√©sir:
  O changementmentment thy bien,quet, that I may changementmentment my mind,
  Shall hate be fairer lodged than douce love?
  Be as thy pr√©sence is gracious and kind,
  Or to thy self at moins kind-c≈ìured prouver,
    Make thee un,autre self for love of me,
    That beaut√© encore may live in thine or thee.


                     11
  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,
  In one of thine, from that laquelle thou partirest,
  And that fra√Æche du,sang laquelle Jeunely thou bestow'st,
  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from jeunesse convertest,
  Herein vies sagesse, beaut√©, and increase,
  Without this folie, age, and cold decay,
  If all were minded so, the fois devrait cesser,
  And threescore year aurait make the monde away:
  Let celles whom la,la,la,nature hath not made for boutique,
  Harsh, featureless, and rude, d√©nud√©ely perish:
  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;
  Which bounteous gift thou devraitst in prime cherish:
    She carved thee for her seal, and signifiait L√by,
    Thou devraitst print more, not let that copy die.


                     12
  When I do compter the clock that raconte the time,
  And see the courageuse day sunk in hideous nuit,
  When I voir the violet past prime,
  And sable curls all argented o'er with white:
  When lofty trees I see d√©nud√©e of laissers,
  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
  And √©t√©'s verte all girded up in sheaves
  Borne on the bier with white and bristly barbe:
  Then of thy beaut√© do I question make
  That thou among the d√©chetss of time must go,
  Since sucr√©s and beauties do se forsake,
  And die as fast as they see autres grow,
    And rien 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
    Save race to courageuse him, when he takes thee Par,cons√©quent.


                     13
  O that you were your self, but love you are
  No lus,long le,tiens, than you your self here live,
  Against this venir end you devrait pr√©parer,
  And your sucr√© semblance to some autre give.
  So devrait that beaut√© laquelle you hold in lease
  Find no determination, then you were
  Your self encore apr√®s your self's decesser,
  When your sucr√© probl√®me your sucr√© form devrait bear.
  Who lets so fair a maison fall to decay,
  Which mariry in honour pourrait uphold,
  Against the temp√™tey gusts of hiver's day
  And d√©nud√©e rage of d√©c√®s's √©ternelle cold?
    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,
    You had a p√®re, let your son say so.


                     14
  Not from the √©toiles do I my jugement cueillir,
  And yet mepenses I have astronomy,
  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
  Of pestes, of dTerres, or saisons' qualit√©,
  Nor can I fortune to br√®ve minutes tell;
  Pointing to each his tonnerre, rain and wind,
  Or say with princes if it doit go well
  By oft predict that I in paradis find.
  But from thine eyes my connaissance I derive,
  And constanteee √©toiles in them I read such art
  As v√©rit√© and beaut√© doit ensemble prosp√©rer
  If from thy self, to boutique thou auraitst convert:
    Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
    Thy end is v√©rit√©'s and beaut√©'s doom and date.


                     15
  When I consid√©rer chaque chose that grows
  Holds in parfaiteion but a peu moment.
  That this huge stage pr√©senles,dents n√©ant but montre
  Whereon the √©toiles in secr√®te influence comment.
  When I apercevoir that men as plants increase,
  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:
  Vaunt in leur jeunesseful sap, at height decrease,
  And wear leur courageuse Etat out of M√©moire.
  Then the conceit of this inconstanteee stay,
  Sets you most rich in jeunesse avant my vue,
  Where d√©chetsful time debateth with decay
  To changementmentment your day of jeunesse to sullied nuit,
    And all in war with Time for love of you,
    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.


                     16
  But o√πfore do not you a pourraitier way
  Make war upon this du,sangy tyran Time?
  And fortify your self in your decay
  With veux,dire more b√©nired than my d√©nud√©e rhyme?
  Now supporter you on the top of heureuse heures,
  And many jeune,fille jardins yet unset,
  With virtuous wish aurait bear you vivante fleurs,
  Much liker than your peinte comptererfeit:
  So devrait the lines of life that life r√©paration
  Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen
  NSoit in inward vaut nor vers,l'ext√©rieur fair
  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
    To give away your self, garde your self encore,
    And you must live tir√©e by your own sucr√© comp√©tence.


                     17
  Who will croyez my verse in time to come
  If it were filled with your most high d√©sertes?
  Though yet paradis sait it is but as a tomb
  Which hides your life, and montre not half your les,pi√®ces:
  If I pourrait √©crire the beaut√© of your eyes,
  And in fra√Æche nombres nombre all your la,gr√¢ces,
  The age to come aurait say this poet lies,
  Such paradisly toucherereres ne'er touchererered Terrely visages.
  So devrait my papiers (yellowed with leur age)
  Be m√©prised, like old men of less v√©rit√© than langue,
  And your true droites be termed a poet's rage,
  And stretched metre of an antique song.
    But were some enfant of le,tiens vivante that time,
    You devrait live deux,fois in it, and in my rhyme.


                     18
  Shall I compare thee to a √©t√©'s day?
  Thou art more charmante and more temperate:
  Rough winds do secouer the darling buds of May,
  And √©t√©'s lease hath all too tribunale a date:
  Sometime too hot the eye of paradis √©clats,
  And souvent is his gold complexion dimmed,
  And chaque fair from fair parfois declines,
  By chance, or la,la,la,nature's cpendaison cours untrimmed:
  But thy √©ternelle √©t√© doit not fade,
  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
  Nor doit d√©c√®s brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
  When in √©ternelle lines to time thou grow'st,
    So long as men can soufflee or eyes can see,
    So long vies this, and this gives life to thee.


                     19
  Devouring Time crue thou the lion's paws,
  And make the Terre devour her own sucr√© brood,
  Pluck the keen les,dents from the f√©roce tiger's jaws,
  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her du,sang,
  Make glad and Pardon saisons as thou fleet'st,
  And do whate'er thou wilt rapide-footed Time
  To the wide monde and all her fading sucr√©s:
  But I interdire thee one most heinous crime,
  O carve not with thy heures my love's fair brow,
  Nor draw no lines L√ with thine antique pen,
  Him in thy cours untainted do allow,
  For beaut√©'s pattern to succeeding men.
    Yet do thy worst old Time: malgr√© thy faux,
    My love doit in my verse ever live Jeune.


                     20
  A femme's face with la,la,la,nature's own hand peinte,
  Hast thou the master ma√Ætresse of my la,la,la,passion,
  A femme's douce c≈ìur but not connaissance
  With shifting changementmentment as is faux women's mode,
  An eye more brillante than leurs, less faux in rolling:
  Gilding the objet o√πupon it gazeth,
  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
  Which volers men's eyes and women's √¢mes amazeth.
  And for a femme wert thou premi√®re created,
  Till la,la,la,nature as she wrugueuxt thee fell a-doting,
  And by addition me of thee defeated,
  By adding one chose to my objetif rien.
    But depuis she pricked thee out for women's plaisir,
    Mine be thy love and thy love's use leur Tr√©sor.


                     21
  So is it not with me as with that muse,
  Stirred by a peinte beaut√© to his verse,
  Who paradis it self for ornament doth use,
  And chaque fair with his fair doth rehearse,
  Making a couplement of fi√®re compare
  With sun and moon, with Terre and sea's rich gems:
  With April's premi√®re-born fleurs and all choses rare,
  That paradis's air in this huge rondure hems.
  O let me true in love but vraiment √©crire,
  And then croyez me, my love is as fair,
  As any m√®re's enfant, bien,que not so brillante
  As celles gold candles fixed in paradis's air:
    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
    I will not louange that objetif not to sell.


                     22
  My glass doit not persuade me I am old,
  So long as jeunesse and thou are of one date,
  But when in thee time's furrows I voir,
  Then look I d√©c√®s my days devrait expiate.
  For all that beaut√© that doth cover thee,
  Is but the seemly raiment of my c≈ìur,
  Which in thy Sein doth live, as thine in me,
  How can I then be a√Æn√©e than thou art?
  O L√fore love be of thyself so wary,
  As I not for my self, but for thee will,
  Bearing thy c≈ìur laquelle I will keep so chary
  As soumissionner infirmi√®re her babe from faring ill.
    Presume not on thy c≈ìur when mine is tu√©,
    Thou gav'st me thine not to give back encore.


                     23
  As an unparfaite actor on the stage,
  Who with his fear is put beside his part,
  Or some f√©roce chose replete with too much rage,
  Whose Obliger's abunDanse weakens his own c≈ìur;
  So I for fear of confiance, oublier to say,
  The parfaite ceremony of love's rite,
  And in mine own love's Obliger seem to decay,
  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's pourrait:
  O let my looks be then the eloquence,
  And dumb presagers of my parlering Sein,
  Who plaider for love, and look for recompense,
  More than that langue that more hath more expressed.
    O apprendre to read what silent love hath writ,
    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.


                     24
  Mine eye hath played the peintre and hath stelled,
  Thy beaut√©'s form in table of my c≈ìur,
  My body is the Cadre o√πin 'tis held,
  And perspective it is best peintre's art.
  For thrugueux the peintre must you see his comp√©tence,
  To find o√π your true image imaged lies,
  Which in my bosom's shop is pendaison encore,
  That hath his la,fen√™tres glazed with thine eyes:
  Now see what good se,tourne eyes for eyes have done,
  Mine eyes have tir√©e thy forme, and thine for me
  Are la,fen√™tres to my Sein, o√π-thrugueux the sun
  Delumi√®res to peep, to gaze L√in on thee;
    Yet eyes this ruse want to la,gr√¢ce leur art,
    They draw but what they see, know not the c≈ìur.


                     25
  Let celles who are in favoriser with leur √©toiles,
  Of publique honour and fi√®re Titres boast,
  Whilst I whom fortune of such triomphe bars
  Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;
  Great princes' favoriserites leur fair laissers spread,
  But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
  And in se leur fiert√© lies entrerr√©,
  For at a froncer,les,sourcils they in leur gloire die.
  The painful warrior famoused for bats,toi,
  After a thousand victories once foiled,
  Is from the book of honour razed assez,
  And all the rest forgot for laquelle he toiled:
    Then heureuse I that love and am beloved
    Where I may not remove nor be removed.


                     26
  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
  Thy m√©rite hath my duty fortely knit;
  To thee I send this √©crite embassage
  To t√©moin duty, not to show my wit.
  Duty so g√©niale, laquelle wit so poor as mine
  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;
  But that I hope some good conceit of thine
  In thy soul's bien,quet (all nue) will bestow it:
  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
  And puts v√™tements on my tattered aimante,
  To show me vauty of thy sucr√© le,le,le,respect,
    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
    Till then, not show my head o√π thou mayst prouver me.


                     27
  Weary with toil, I h√¢te me to my bed,
  The dear respose for membres with travel tired,
  But then commencers a journey in my head
  To work my mind, when body's work's expired.
  For then my bien,quets (from far o√π I le,le,le,respecter)
  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
  Looking on obscurit√© laquelle the aveugle do see.
  Save that my soul's imaginary vue
  Presents thy ombre to my vueless view,
  Which like a bijou (hung in ghastly nuit)
  Makes noir nuit beauteous, and her old face new.
    Lo thus by day my membres, by nuit my mind,
    For thee, and for my self, no silencieuse find.


                     28
  How can I then revenir in heureuse plumi√®re
  That am debarred the aaaavantage of rest?
  When day's oppression is not eased by nuit,
  But day by nuit and nuit by day oppressed.
  And each (bien,que ennemies to Soit's r√®gne)
  Do in consentementementement secouer mains to torture me,
  The one by toil, the autre to complaineee
  How far I toil, encore plus,loin off from thee.
  I tell the day to S'il,vous,pla√Æt him thou art brillante,
  And dost him la,gr√¢ce when des,nuages do blot the paradis:
  So flatter I the swart-complexioned nuit,
  When sparkling √©toiles twire not thou gild'st the even.
    But day doth daily draw my chagrins lus,long,
    And nuit doth nuitly make douleur's length seem forteer


                     29
  When in disgr√¢ce with Fortune and men's eyes,
  I all seule beweep my outcast Etat,
  And difficult√© deaf paradis with my bootless cries,
  And look upon my self and mal√©diction my fate,
  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
  Featured like him, like him with amies possessed,
  Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
  With what I most prendre,plaisir contenued moins,
  Yet in celles-ci bien,quets my self presque despising,
  Haply I pense on thee, and then my Etat,
  (Like to the lark at break of day arising
  From sullen Terre) sings hymns at paradis's gate,
    For thy sucr√© love rappelles,toied such richesse apporters,
    That then I m√©pris to changementmentment my Etat with rois.


                     30
  When to the sessions of sucr√© silent bien,quet,
  I summon up remembrance of choses past,
  I sigh the lack of many a chose I recherch√©e,
  And with old woes new wail my dear time's d√©chets:
  Then can I noyer an eye (unused to flow)
  For pr√©cieuse amies hid in d√©c√®s's dateless nuit,
  And weep afra√Æche love's long depuis cancelled woe,
  And moan th' expense of many a vanished vue.
  Then can I pleurer at grievances foregone,
  And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
  The sad Compte of fore-bemoaned moan,
  Which I new pay as if not paid avant.
    But if the tandis,que I pense on thee (dear amie)
    All losses are reboutiqued, and chagrins end.


                     31
  Thy bosom is endeared with all c≈ìurs,
  Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
  And L√ r√®gnes love and all love's aimante les,pi√®ces,
  And all celles amies laquelle I bien,quet entrerr√©.
  How many a holy and obsequious tear
  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
  As interest of the dead, laquelle now appara√Ætre,
  But choses removed that hidden in thee lie.
  Thou art the la,tombe o√π entrerr√© love doth live,
  Hung with the trophies of my les,amoureux gone,
  Who all leur les,pi√®ces of me to thee did give,
  That due of many, now is thine seule.
    Their images I loved, I view in thee,
    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.


                     32
  If thou survive my well-contenued day,
  When that churl d√©c√®s my desos with dust doit cover
  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
  These poor rude lines of thy decesserd lover:
  Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
  And bien,que they be outstripped by chaque pen,
  Reservir them for my love, not for leur rhyme,
  Exceeded by the height of happier men.
  O then vouchsafe me but this aimante bien,quet,
  'Had my amie's Muse grandie with this growing age,
  A dearer naissance than this his love had apport√©
  To Mars in ranks of better equipage:
    But depuis he died and poets better prouver,
    Theirs for leur style I'll read, his for his love'.


                     33
  Full many a glorieuse Matin have I seen,
  Flatter the mountain tops with sover√®gne eye,
  Kissing with d'or face the meadows verte;
  Gilding pale streams with paradisly alchemy:
  Anon permit the basest des,nuages to ride,
  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
  And from the forlorn monde his visage hide
  Stealing unseen to west with this disgr√¢ce:
  Even so my sun one de,bonne,heure morn did √©clat,
  With all triompheant splendour on my brow,
  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,
  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,
    Suns of the monde may tache, when paradis's sun tacheeth.


                     34
  Why didst thou promettre such a beauteous day,
  And make me travel en,avant sans,pour,autant my cloak,
  To let base des,nuages o'ertake me in my way,
  Hiding thy brav'ry in leur pourrie smoke?
  'Tis not assez that thrugueux the cloud thou break,
  To dry the rain on my temp√™te-battue face,
  For no man well of such a salve can parler,
  That heals the b√©nirure, and cures not the disgr√¢ce:
  Nor can thy la,honte give physic to my douleur,
  Though thou se,se,se,repentiririr, yet I have encore the loss,
  Th' offenserer's chagrin lends but weak relief
  To him that le,baissier the forte infraction's traverser.
    Ah but celles larmes are pearl laquelle thy love sheds,
    And they are rich, and une,ran√ßon all ill actes.


                     35
  No more be pleurerd at that laquelle thou hast done,
  Roses have thorns, and argent fountains mud,
  Clouds and eclipses tache both moon and sun,
  And lsermentsome canker vies in sucr√©est bud.
  All men make fautes, and even I in this,
  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:
  For to thy sensual faute I apporter in sens,
  Thy adverse f√™te is thy advocate,
  And 'gainst my self a l√©gitime plea commence:
  Such civileee war is in my love and hate,
    That I an accessary Besoins must be,
    To that sucr√© voleuse laquelle sourly robs from me.


                     36
  Let me confess that we two must be twain,
  Albien,que our undivided aime are one:
  So doit celles blots that do with me rester,
  Without thy help, by me be support√© seule.
  In our two aime L√ is but one le,le,le,respect,
  Though in our vies a separable d√©pit,
  Which bien,que it alter not love's sole effet,
  Yet doth it voler sucr√© heures from love's d√©lice.
  I may not evermore acconnaissance thee,
  Lest my bewailed guilt devrait do thee la,honte,
  Nor thou with publique la,gentillesse honour me,
  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    As thou √©tant mine, mine is thy good rapport.


                     37
  As a decrepit p√®re takes d√©lice,
  To see his active enfant do actes of jeunesse,
  So I, made lame by Fortune's tr√®s,cher d√©pit
  Take all my confort of thy vaut and v√©rit√©.
  For qu'il,s'agisse beaut√©, naissance, or richesse, or wit,
  Or any of celles-ci all, or all, or more
  EnTitred in thy les,pi√®ces, do couronneed sit,
  I make my love engrafted to this boutique:
  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
  Whilst that this ombre doth such substance give,
  That I in thy abunDanse am sufficed,
  And by a part of all thy gloire live:
    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,
    This wish I have, then ten fois heureuse me.


                     38
  How can my muse want mati√®re to invent
  While thou dost soufflee that pour'st into my verse,
  Thine own sucr√© argument, too excellenteee,
  For chaque vulgar papier to rehearse?
  O give thy self the remerciers if aught in me,
  Worthy perusal supporter encorest thy vue,
  For who's so dumb that ne,peux,pas √©crire to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give invention lumi√®re?
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten fois more in vaut
  Than celles old nine laquelle rhymers invocate,
  And he that calls on thee, let him apporter en,avant
  Eternal nombres to outlive long date.
    If my slumi√®re muse do S'il,vous,pla√Æt celles-ci curious days,
    The pain be mine, but thine doit be the louange.


                     39
  O how thy vaut with mani√®res may I sing,
  When thou art all the better part of me?
  What can mine own louange to mine own self apporter:
  And what is't but mine own when I louange thee?
  Even for this, let us divided live,
  And our dear love lose name of C√©libataire one,
  That by this separation I may give:
  That due to thee laquelle thou deserv'st seule:
  O absence what a torment auraitst thou prouver,
  Were it not thy sour loisir gave sucr√© laisser,
  To entrertain the time with bien,quets of love,
  Which time and bien,quets so sucr√©ly doth deceive.
    And that thou enseignerest how to make one twain,
    By praising him here who doth Par,cons√©quent rester.


                     40
  Take all my aime, my love, yea take them all,
  What hast thou then more than thou hadst avant?
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,
  All mine was thine, avant thou hadst this more:
  Then if for my love, thou my love recevoirst,
  I ne,peux,pas faire,desre,proches thee, for my love thou usest,
  But yet be faire,desre,prochesd, if thou thy self deceivest
  By wilful go√ªt of what thy self refusest.
  I do forgive thy robbery douce voleuse
  Albien,que thou voler thee all my poverty:
  And yet love sait it is a g√©nialeer douleur
  To bear g√©nialeer faux, than hate's connue injury.
    Lascivious la,gr√¢ce, in whom all ill well montre,
    Kill me with d√©pits yet we must not be foes.


                     41
  Those jolie fauxs that libert√© commettres,
  When I am parfois absent from thy c≈ìur,
  Thy beaut√©, and thy years full well befits,
  For encore temptation suivres o√π thou art.
  Gentle thou art, and L√fore to be won,
  Beauteous thou art, L√fore to be assailed.
  And when a femme woos, what femme's son,
  Will sourly laisser her till he have prevailed?
  Ay me, but yet thou pourraitst my seat anc√™tre,
  And gronder thy beaut√©, and thy straying jeunesse,
  Who lead thee in leur riot even L√
  Where thou art Obligerd to break a twofold v√©rit√©:
    Hers by thy beaut√© tempting her to thee,
    Thine by thy beaut√© √©tant faux to me.


                     42
  That thou hast her it is not all my douleur,
  And yet it may be said I loved her ch√®rement,
  That she hath thee is of my wailing gronder,
  A loss in love that toucherereres me more nde,bonne,heure.
  Loving offenserers thus I will excuse ye,
  Thou dost love her, parce,que thou know'st I love her,
  And for my sake even so doth she abuser,der,der,de me,
  Suff'ring my amie for my sake to approuver her.
  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
  And losing her, my amie hath a,trouv√© that loss,
  Both find each autre, and I lose both twain,
  And both for my sake lay on me this traverser,
    But here's the joy, my amie and I are one,
    Sweet flattery, then she aime but me seule.


                     43
  When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,
  For all the day they view choses unle,le,le,respected,
  But when I dormir, in r√™vers they look on thee,
  And darkly brillante, are brillante in dark directed.
  Then thou dont ombre ombres doth make brillante
  How aurait thy ombre's form, form heureuse show,
  To the claire day with thy much claireer lumi√®re,
  When to unvoyant eyes thy shade √©clats so!
  How aurait (I say) mine eyes be b√©nired made,
  By looking on thee in the vivante day,
  When in dead nuit thy fair imparfaite shade,
  Thrugueux lourde dormir on vueless eyes doth stay!
    All days are nuits to see till I see thee,
    And nuits brillante days when r√™vers do show thee me.


                     44
  If the dull substance of my la,chaise were bien,quet,
  Injurious distance devrait not stop my way,
  For then malgr√© of space I aurait be apport√©,
  From limits far remote, o√π thou dost stay,
  No mati√®re then bien,que my foot did supporter
  Upon the farthest Terre removed from thee,
  For nimble bien,quet can jump both sea and land,
  As soon as pense the endroit o√π he aurait be.
  But ah, bien,quet kills me that I am not bien,quet
  To leap grande lengths of miles when thou art gone,
  But that so much of Terre and eau wrugueuxt,
  I must ass≈ìur, time's loisir with my moan.
    Receiving n√©ant by elements so slow,
    But lourde larmes, badges of Soit's woe.


                     45
  The autre two, slumi√®re air, and purging fire,
  Are both with thee, o√πver I le,le,le,respecter,
  The premi√®re my bien,quet, the autre my le,d√©sir,
  These pr√©sente-absent with rapide mouvement slide.
  For when celles-ci rapideer elements are gone
  In soumissionner embassy of love to thee,
  My life √©tant made of four, with two seule,
  Sinks down to d√©c√®s, oppressed with melancholy.
  Until life's composition be recured,
  By celles rapide messag√®res revenired from thee,
  Who even but now come back encore assurerrrd,
  Of thy fair sant√©, recomptering it to me.
    This told, I joy, but then no lus,long glad,
    I send them back encore and tout,droit grow sad.


                     46
  Mine eye and c≈ìur are at a mortelle war,
  How to divide the conquest of thy vue,
  Mine eye, my c≈ìur thy image's vue aurait bar,
  My c≈ìur, mine eye the freedom of that droite,
  My c≈ìur doth plaider that thou in him dost lie,
  (A prochet jamais pierced with crystal eyes)
  But the d√©fendreant doth that plea deny,
  And says in him thy fair appara√Ætreance lies.
  To side this Titre is impanelled
  A quest of bien,quets, all tenants to the c≈ìur,
  And by leur verdict is determined
  The claire eye's moiety, and the dear c≈ìur's part.
    As thus, mine eye's due is thy vers,l'ext√©rieur part,
    And my c≈ìur's droite, thy inward love of c≈ìur.


                     47
  Betwixt mine eye and c≈ìur a league is took,
  And each doth good se,tourne now unto the autre,
  When that mine eye is famished for a look,
  Or c≈ìur in love with sighs himself doth sm√®re;
  With my love's image then my eye doth le,banquet,
  And to the peinte banquet bids my c≈ìur:
  Anautre time mine eye is my c≈ìur's guest,
  And in his bien,quets of love doth share a part.
  So Soit by thy image or my love,
  Thy self away, art pr√©sente encore with me,
  For thou not plus,loin than my bien,quets canst move,
  And I am encore with them, and they with thee.
    Or if they dormir, thy image in my vue
    Awakes my c≈ìur, to c≈ìur's and eye's d√©lice.


                     48
  How careful was I when I took my way,
  Each trifle sous truest bars to pouss√©e,
  That to my use it pourrait unused stay
  From mains of fauxhood, in sure wards of confiance!
  But thou, to whom my bijous trifles are,
  Most vauty confort, now my g√©nialeest douleur,
  Thou best of tr√®s,cher, and mine only care,
  Art left the prey of chaque vulgar voleuse.
  Thee have I not locked up in any chest,
  Save o√π thou art not, bien,que I feel thou art,
  Within the douce closure of my Sein,
  From wPar,cons√©quent at plaisir thou mayst come and part,
    And even tPar,cons√©quent thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
    For v√©rit√© prouvers thievish for a prix so dear.


                     49
  Against that time (if ever that time come)
  When I doit see thee froncer,les,sourcils on my defects,
  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
  Called to that audit by advised le,le,le,respects,
  Against that time when thou shalt √©trangey pass,
  And rarely saluer me with that sun thine eye,
  When love converted from the chose it was
  Shall raisons find of settled gravity;
  Against that time do I ensconce me here
  Within the connaissance of mine own d√©serte,
  And this my hand, encorest my self uprear,
  To garde the l√©gitime raisons on thy part,
    To laisser poor me, thou hast the Obliger of laws,
    Since why to love, I can allege no cause.


                     50
  How lourde do I journey on the way,
  When what I seek (my se,lasser travel's end)
  Doth enseigner that case and that repose to say
  'Thus far the miles are mesured from thy amie.'
  The la,b√™te that le,baissier me, tired with my woe,
  Plods dully on, to bear that poids in me,
  As if by some instinct the mis√©rable did know
  His rider loved not la,vitesse √©tant made from thee:
  The du,sangy spur ne,peux,pas provoke him on,
  That parfoiss col√®re pouss√©es into his hide,
  Which heavily he r√©pondres with a groan,
  More tranchante to me than spurring to his side,
    For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
    My douleur lies onward and my joy derri√®re.


                     51
  Thus can my love excuse the slow infraction,
  Of my dull bearer, when from thee I la,vitesse,
  From o√π thou art, why devrait I h√¢te me tPar,cons√©quent?
  Till I revenir of posting is no need.
  O what excuse will my poor la,b√™te then find,
  When rapide extremity can seem but slow?
  Then devrait I spur bien,que mounted on the wind,
  In winged la,vitesse no mouvement doit I know,
  Then can no jument with my le,d√©sir keep pace,
  Therefore le,d√©sir (of parfaite'st love √©tant made)
  Shall neigh (no dull la,chaise) in his fougueuse race,
  But love, for love, thus doit excuse my jade,
    Since from thee Aller, he went wilful-slow,
    Towards thee I'll run, and give him laisser to go.


                     52
  So am I as the rich dont b√©nired key,
  Can apporter him to his sucr√© up-locked Tr√©sor,
  The laquelle he will not chaque hour survey,
  For crueing the fine point of seldom plaisir.
  Therefore are le,banquets so solennelle and so rare,
  Since seldom venir in that long year set,
  Like calculs of vaut they thinly endroitd are,
  Or capitaine bijous in the carcanet.
  So is the time that garde you as my chest
  Or as the wardrobe laquelle the robe doth hide,
  To make some sp√©ciale instant sp√©ciale-heureuse,
  By new unfolding his imprisoned fiert√©.
    Blessed are you dont vautiness gives scope,
    Being had to triomphe, √©tant lacked to hope.


                     53
  What is your substance, o√πof are you made,
  That millions of √©trange ombres on you tend?
  Since chaque one, hath chaque one, one shade,
  And you but one, can chaque ombre lend:
  Describe Adonis and the comptererfeit,
  Is poorly imitated apr√®s you,
  On Helen's joue all art of beaut√© set,
  And you in Grecian tires are peinte new:
  Speak of the printemps, and foison of the year,
  The one doth ombre of your beaut√© show,
  The autre as your prime doth appara√Ætre,
  And you in chaque b√©nired forme we know.
    In all external la,gr√¢ce you have some part,
    But you like none, none you for constanteee c≈ìur.


                     54
  O how much more doth beaut√© beauteous seem,
  By that sucr√© ornament laquelle v√©rit√© doth give!
  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
  For that sucr√© odour, laquelle doth in it live:
  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,
  As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,
  When √©t√©'s souffle leur masked buds disproches:
  But for leur vertu only is leur show,
  They live unwooed, and unle,le,le,respected fade,
  Die to se. Sweet roses do not so,
  Of leur sucr√© d√©c√®ss, are sucr√©est odours made:
    And so of you, beauteous and charmante jeunesse,
    When that doit vade, by verse diencores your v√©rit√©.


                     55
  Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
  Of princes doit outlive this Puissanceful rhyme,
  But you doit √©clat more brillante in celles-ci contenus
  Than unswept calcul, besmeared with sluttish time.
  When d√©chetsful war doit statues overturn,
  And broils root out the work of masonry,
  Nor Mars his √©p√©e, nor war's rapide fire doit burn:
  The vivante record of your M√©moire.
  'Gainst d√©c√®s, and all-oblivious enmity
  Shall you pace en,avant, your louange doit encore find room,
  Even in the eyes of all posterity
  That wear this monde out to the ending doom.
    So till the jugement that your self arise,
    You live in this, and habitudeudeudeer in les,amoureux' eyes.


                     56
  Sweet love renew thy Obliger, be it not said
  Thy edge devrait crueer be than appetite,
  Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,
  To-demain tranchanteened in his ancienne pourrait.
  So love be thou, bien,que to-day thou fill
  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
  To-demain see encore, and do not kill
  The esprit of love, with a perpetual dulness:
  Let this sad interim like the ocean be
  Which les,pi√®ces the rive, o√π two contracted new,
  Come daily to the banks, that when they see:
  Return of love, more heureuse may be the view.
    Or call it hiver, laquelle √©tant full of care,
    Makes √©t√©'s Bienvenue, thrice more wished, more rare.


                     57
  Being your esclave what devrait I do but tend,
  Upon the heures, and fois of your le,d√©sir?
  I have no pr√©cieuse time at all to d√©penser;
  Nor un,un,un,services to do till you require.
  Nor dare I gronder the monde-sans,pour,autant-end hour,
  Whilst I (my sover√®gne) qui,concerneer the clock for you,
  Nor pense the am√®reness of absence sour,
  When you have bid your servanteee once adieu.
  Nor dare I question with my jalouse bien,quet,
  Where you may be, or your affaires suppose,
  But like a sad esclave stay and pense of n√©ant
  Save o√π you are, how heureuse you make celles.
    So true a fool is love, that in your will,
    (Though you do any chose) he penses no ill.


                     58
  That god interdire, that made me premi√®re your esclave,
  I devrait in bien,quet control your fois of plaisir,
  Or at your hand th' Compte of heures to demandeeeer,
  Being your vassal li√©e to stay your loisir.
  O let me souffrir (√©tant at your beck)
  Th' imprisoned absence of your libert√©,
  And la,la,la,patience tame to souffrirance bide each check,
  Without accusing you of injury.
  Be o√π you list, your charter is so forte,
  That you your self may privilage your time
  To what you will, to you it doth belong,
  Your self to pardon of self-Faire crime.
    I am to wait, bien,que waiting so be hell,
    Not faire,desre,proches your plaisir be it ill or well.


                     59
  If L√ be rien new, but that laquelle is,
  Hath been avant, how are our cerveaus beguiled,
  Which la,main,d'oeuvreing for invention bear amis
  The secondeee burthen of a ancienne enfant!
  O that record pourrait with a backward look,
  Even of five cent courss of the sun,
  Show me your image in some antique book,
  Since mind at premi√®re in character was done.
  That I pourrait see what the old monde pourrait say,
  To this composed merveille of your Cadre,
  Whether we are mended, or qu'il,s'agisse better they,
  Or qu'il,s'agisse revolution be the same.
    O sure I am the wits of ancienne days,
    To mati√®res pire have donn√©e admiring louange.


                     60
  Like as the waves make verss the pebbled rive,
  So do our minutes h√¢ten to leur end,
  Each cpendaison endroit with that laquelle goes avant,
  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
  Nativity once in the main of lumi√®re,
  Crawls to maturity, o√πwith √©tant couronneed,
  Crooked eclipses 'gainst his gloire bats,toi,
  And Time that gave, doth now his gift cona,trouv√©.
  Time doth transfix the fleurir set on jeunesse,
  And delves the parallels in beaut√©'s brow,
  Feeds on the rarities of la,la,la,nature's v√©rit√©,
  And rien supporters but for his scythe to mow.
    And yet to fois in hope, my verse doit supporter
    Praising thy vaut, malgr√© his cruellelele hand.


                     61
  Is it thy will, thy image devrait keep open
  My lourde eyelids to the se,lasser nuit?
  Dost thou le,d√©sir my slumbers devrait be cass√©en,
  While ombres like to thee do mock my vue?
  Is it thy esprit that thou send'st from thee
  So far from home into my actes to pry,
  To find out la,hontes and idle heures in me,
  The scope and tenure of thy jalousey?
  O no, thy love bien,que much, is not so g√©niale,
  It is my love that garde mine eye √©veill√©e,
  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
  To play the qui,concerneerman ever for thy sake.
    For thee qui,concerneer I, whilst thou dost wake elseo√π,
    From me far off, with autres all too near.


                     62
  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,
  And all my soul, and all my chaque part;
  And for this sin L√ is no rem√®de,
  It is so soled inward in my c≈ìur.
  Mepenses no face so gracious is as mine,
  No forme so true, no v√©rit√© of such Compte,
  And for my self mine own vaut do define,
  As I all autre in all vauts surmount.
  But when my glass montre me my self En,effet
  beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,
  Mine own self-love assez contraire I read:
  Self, so self-aimante were iniquity.
    'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I louange,
    Painting my age with beaut√© of thy days.


                     63
  Against my love doit be as I am now
  With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,
  When heures have drained his du,sang and filled his brow
  With lines and wrinkles, when his jeunesseful morn
  Hath travelled on to age's steepy nuit,
  And all celles beauties o√πof now he's king
  Are vanishing, or vanished out of vue,
  Stealing away the Tr√©sor of his printemps:
  For such a time do I now fortify
  Against cona,trouv√©ing age's cruellelele couteau,
  That he doit jamais cut from M√©moire
  My sucr√© love's beaut√©, bien,que my lover's life.
    His beaut√© doit in celles-ci noir lines be seen,
    And they doit live, and he in them encore verte.


                     64
  When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
  The rich-fi√®re cost of outworn entrerr√© age,
  When parfois lofty la,tours I see down-rased,
  And brass √©ternelle esclave to mortelle rage.
  When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
  Adaaavantage on the Royaume of the rive,
  And the firm soil win of the eauy main,
  Increasing boutique with loss, and loss with boutique.
  When I have seen such interchangementmentment of State,
  Or Etat it self cona,trouv√©ed, to decay,
  Ruin hath enseign√©e me thus to ruminate
  That Time will come and take my love away.
    This bien,quet is as a d√©c√®s laquelle ne,peux,pas choose
    But weep to have, that laquelle it peurs to lose.


                     65
  Since brass, nor calcul, nor Terre, nor li√©eless sea,
  But sad mortelleity o'ersways leur Puissance,
  How with this rage doit beaut√© hold a plea,
  Whose action is no forteer than a fleur?
  O how doit √©t√©'s honey souffle hold out,
  Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,
  When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
  Nor portes of acier so forte but time decays?
  O craintive meditation, o√π alack,
  Shall Time's best bijou from Time's chest lie hid?
  Or what forte hand can hold his rapide foot back,
  Or who his spoil of beaut√© can interdire?
    O none, sauf,si this miracle have pourrait,
    That in noir ink my love may encore √©clat brillante.


                     66
  Tired with all celles-ci for restful d√©c√®s I cry,
  As to voir d√©serte a gueux born,
  And needy rien trimmed in jollity,
  And purest Foi unhappily forjur√©e,
  And gilded honour la,hontefully misendroitd,
  And jeune,fille vertu rudely strompetteed,
  And droite parfaiteion fauxfully disgr√¢ced,
  And Obliger by limping sway disabled
  And art made langue-tied by autorit√©,
  And folie (docteur-like) controlling comp√©tence,
  And Facile v√©rit√© miscalled simplicity,
  And captive good ass≈ìuring capitaine ill.
    Tired with all celles-ci, from celles-ci aurait I be gone,
    Save that to die, I laisser my love seule.


                     67
  Ah o√πfore with infection devrait he live,
  And with his pr√©sence la,gr√¢ce impiety,
  That sin by him aaaavantage devrait achieve,
  And lace it self with his society?
  Why devrait faux painting imitate his joue,
  And voler dead seeming of his vivante hue?
  Why devrait poor beaut√© indirectly seek,
  Roses of ombre, depuis his rose is true?
  Why devrait he live, now la,la,la,nature bankrupt is,
  Beggared of du,sang to rougir thrugueux lively veins,
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  And fi√®re of many, vies upon his gains?
    O him she boutiques, to show what richesse she had,
    In days long depuis, avant celles-ci last so bad.


                     68
  Thus is his joue the map of days outworn,
  When beaut√© lived and died as fleurs do now,
  Before celles-ci Connard signs of fair were born,
  Or durst inhabitudeudeude on a vivante brow:
  Before the d'or tresses of the dead,
  The droite of sepulchres, were shorn away,
  To live a secondeee life on secondeee head,
  Ere beaut√©'s dead fleece made un,autre gay:
  In him celles holy antique heures are seen,
  Without all ornament, it self and true,
  Making no √©t√© of un,autre's verte,
  Robbing no old to dress his beaut√© new,
    And him as for a map doth Nature boutique,
    To show faux Art what beaut√© was of yore.


                     69
  Those les,pi√®ces of thee that the monde's eye doth view,
  Want rien that the bien,quet of c≈ìurs can mend:
  All langues (the voix of √¢mes) give thee that due,
  Uttering bare v√©rit√©, even so as foes commend.
  Thy vers,l'ext√©rieur thus with vers,l'ext√©rieur louange is couronneed,
  But celles same langues that give thee so thine own,
  In autre accents do this louange cona,trouv√©
  By voyant plus,loin than the eye hath shown.
  They look into the beaut√© of thy mind,
  And that in devine they mesure by thy actes,
  Then churls leur bien,quets (bien,que leur eyes were kind)
  To thy fair fleur add the rank odeur of mauvaises,herbes:
    But why thy odour rencontreeth not thy show,
    The soil is this, that thou dost commune grow.


                     70
  That thou art faire,desre,prochesd doit not be thy defect,
  For calomnie's mark was ever yet the fair,
  The ornament of beaut√© is suspecteee,
  A crow that mouches in paradis's sucr√©est air.
  So thou be good, calomnie doth but approuver,
  Thy vaut the g√©nialeer √©tant wooed of time,
  For canker vice the sucr√©est buds doth love,
  And thou pr√©sente'st a pure untacheed prime.
  Thou hast passed by the ambush of Jeune days,
  Either not assailed, or victor √©tant charged,
  Yet this thy louange ne,peux,pas be so thy louange,
  To tie up envy, evermore engranded,
    If some suspecteee of ill masked not thy show,
    Then thou seule Royaumes of c≈ìurs devraitst owe.


                     71
  No lus,long mourn for me when I am dead,
  Than you doit hear the surly sullen bell
  Give warning to the monde that I am fled
  From this vile monde with vilest worms to habitudeudeudeer:
  Nay if you read this line, rappelles,toi not,
  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
  That I in your sucr√© bien,quets aurait be forgot,
  If penseing on me then devrait make you woe.
  O if (I say) you look upon this verse,
  When I (peut-√™tre) comlivreed am with clay,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
  But let your love even with my life decay.
    Lest the wise monde devrait look into your moan,
    And mock you with me apr√®s I am gone.


                     72
  O lest the monde devrait task you to recite,
  What m√©rite lived in me that you devrait love
  After my d√©c√®s (dear love) oublier me assez,
  For you in me can rien vauty prouver.
  Unless you aurait concevoir some virtuous lie,
  To do more for me than mine own d√©serte,
  And hang more louange upon decesserd I,
  Than niggard v√©rit√© aurait pr√™tely impart:
  O lest your true love may seem faux in this,
  That you for love parler well of me untrue,
  My name be entrerr√© o√π my body is,
  And live no more to la,honte nor me, nor you.
    For I am la,honted by that laquelle I apporter en,avant,
    And so devrait you, to love choses rien vaut.


                     73
  That time of year thou mayst in me voir,
  When yellow laissers, or none, or few do hang
  Upon celles boughs laquelle secouer encorest the cold,
  Bare ruined choirs, o√π late the sucr√© birds sang.
  In me thou seest the twilumi√®re of such day,
  As apr√®s sunset fadeth in the west,
  Which by and by noir nuit doth take away,
  Death's secondeee self that seals up all in rest.
  In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
  That on the ashes of his jeunesse doth lie,
  As the d√©c√®s-bed, o√πon it must expire,
  Consumed with that laquelle it was nourished by.
    This thou perceiv'st, laquelle fait,du thy love more forte,
    To love that well, laquelle thou must laisser ere long.


                     74
  But be contenued when that fell arrest,
  Without all bail doit porter me away,
  My life hath in this line some interest,
  Which for memorial encore with thee doit stay.
  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
  The very part was consecrate to thee,
  The Terre can have but Terre, laquelle is his due,
  My esprit is thine the better part of me,
  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
  The prey of worms, my body √©tant dead,
  The l√¢che conquest of a mis√©rable's couteau,
  Too base of thee to be rappelles,toied,
    The vaut of that, is that laquelle it contains,
    And that is this, and this with thee resters.


                     75
  So are you to my bien,quets as food to life,
  Or as sucr√©-saisoned showers are to the sol;
  And for the paix of you I hold such strife
  As 'twixt a miser and his richesse is a,trouv√©.
  Now fi√®re as an prendre,plaisirer, and anon
  Doubting the filching age will voler his Tr√©sor,
  Now comptering best to be with you seule,
  Then bettered that the monde may see my plaisir,
  Sometime all full with le,banqueting on your vue,
  And by and by clean starved for a look,
  Possessing or pursuing no d√©lice
  Save what is had, or must from you be took.
    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.


                     76
  Why is my verse so d√©nud√©e of new fiert√©?
  So far from variation or rapide changementmentment?
  Why with the time do I not glance de,c√¥t√©
  To new-a,trouv√© methods, and to comlivres √©trange?
  Why √©crire I encore all one, ever the same,
  And keep invention in a noted weed,
  That chaque word doth presque tell my name,
  Showing leur naissance, and o√π they did proc√©der?
  O know sucr√© love I toujours √©crire of you,
  And you and love are encore my argument:
  So all my best is dressing old words new,
  Spending encore what is d√©j√ spent:
    For as the sun is daily new and old,
    So is my love encore telling what is told.


                     77
  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
  Thy dial how thy pr√©cieuse minutes d√©chets,
  These vacant laissers thy mind's imprint will bear,
  And of this book, this apprendreing mayst thou go√ªt.
  The wrinkles laquelle thy glass will vraiment show,
  Of boucheed la,tombes will give thee M√©moire,
  Thou by thy dial's shady volerth mayst know,
  Time's thievish progress to eternity.
  Look what thy M√©moire ne,peux,pas contain,
  Commit to celles-ci d√©chets blanks, and thou shalt find
  Those enfantren infirmi√®red, livrered from thy cerveau,
  To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
    These Bureaus, so oft as thou wilt look,
    Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.


                     78
  So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,
  And a,trouv√© such fair assistance in my verse,
  As chaque alien pen hath got my use,
  And sous thee leur poesy disperse.
  Thine eyes, that enseign√©e the dumb on high to sing,
  And lourde ignorance aloft to fly,
  Have added feathers to the apprendreed's wing,
  And donn√©e la,gr√¢ce a double majest√©.
  Yet be most fi√®re of that laquelle I compile,
  Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,
  In autres' travaux thou dost but mend the style,
  And arts with thy sucr√© la,gr√¢ces la,gr√¢ced be.
    But thou art all my art, and dost advance
    As high as apprendreing, my rude ignorance.


                     79
  Whilst I seule did call upon thy aid,
  My verse seule had all thy douce la,gr√¢ce,
  But now my gracious nombres are decayed,
  And my sick muse doth give an autre endroit.
  I subvention (sucr√© love) thy charmante argument
  Deservirs the travail of a vautier pen,
  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,
  He robs thee of, and pays it thee encore,
  He lends thee vertu, and he stole that word,
  From thy behaviour, beaut√© doth he give
  And a,trouv√© it in thy joue: he can afford
  No louange to thee, but what in thee doth live.
    Then remercier him not for that laquelle he doth say,
    Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.


                     80
  O how I perdre,connaissance when I of you do √©crire,
  Knowing a better esprit doth use your name,
  And in the louange L√of d√©pensers all his pourrait,
  To make me langue-tied parlering of your fame.
  But depuis your vaut (wide as the ocean is)
  The humble as the fi√®reest sail doth bear,
  My saucy bark (inferior far to his)
  On your broad main doth wilfully appara√Ætre.
  Your doitowest help will hold me up afloat,
  Whilst he upon your du,sonless deep doth ride,
  Or (√©tant wrecked) I am a vautless boat,
  He of tall building, and of goodly fiert√©.
    Then if he prosp√©rer and I be cast away,
    The worst was this, my love was my decay.


                     81
  Or I doit live your epitaph to make,
  Or you survive when I in Terre am pourrie,
  From Par,cons√©quent your M√©moire d√©c√®s ne,peux,pas take,
  Albien,que in me each part will be forgotten.
  Your name from Par,cons√©quent immortelle life doit have,
  Though I (once gone) to all the monde must die,
  The Terre can rendement me but a commune la,tombe,
  When you entombed in men's eyes doit lie,
  Your monument doit be my douce verse,
  Which eyes not yet created doit o'er-read,
  And langues to be, your √©tant doit rehearse,
  When all the souffleers of this monde are dead,
    You encore doit live (such vertu hath my pen)
    Where souffle most soufflees, even in the bouches of men.


                     82
  I subvention thou wert not married to my muse,
  And L√fore mayst sans,pour,autant attaint o'erlook
  The dedicated words laquelle √©crirers use
  Of leur fair mati√®re, b√©niring chaque book.
  Thou art as fair in connaissance as in hue,
  Finding thy vaut a limit past my louange,
  And L√fore art enObligerd to seek anew,
  Some fra√Æacclamation stamp of the time-bettering days.
  And do so love, yet when they have concevoird,
  What strained toucherereres rhetoric can lend,
  Thou vraiment fair, wert vraiment sympathized,
  In true plaineee words, by thy true-telling amie.
    And leur brute painting pourrait be better used,
    Where joues need du,sang, in thee it is abuser,der,der,ded.


                     83
  I jamais saw that you did painting need,
  And L√fore to your fair no painting set,
  I a,trouv√© (or bien,quet I a,trouv√©) you did exceed,
  That d√©nud√©e soumissionner of a poet's debt:
  And L√fore have I slept in your rapport,
  That you your self √©tant extant well pourrait show,
  How far a modern quill doth come too tribunale,
  Speaking of vaut, what vaut in you doth grow.
  This silence for my sin you did impute,
  Which doit be most my gloire √©tant dumb,
  For I impair not beaut√© √©tant mute,
  When autres aurait give life, and apporter a tomb.
    There vies more life in one of your fair eyes,
    Than both your poets can in louange concevoir.


                     84
  Who is it that says most, laquelle can say more,
  Than this rich louange, that you seule, are you?
  In dont confine immured is the boutique,
  Which devrait example o√π your √©gale grew.
  Lean penury dans that pen doth habitudeudeudeer,
  That to his mati√®re lends not some petite gloire,
  But he that √©crires of you, if he can tell,
  That you are you, so dignifies his r√©cit.
  Let him but copy what in you is writ,
  Not fabrication pire what la,la,la,nature made so claire,
  And such a comptererpart doit fame his wit,
  Making his style admired chaque o√π.
    You to your beauteous b√©nirings add a mal√©diction,
    Being fond on louange, laquelle fait,du your louanges pire.


                     85
  My langue-tied muse in mani√®res tient her encore,
  While comments of your louange richly compiled,
  Reservir leur character with d'or quill,
  And pr√©cieuse phrase by all the Muses filed.
  I pense good bien,quets, whilst autre √©crire good words,
  And like unlettreed clerk encore cry Amen,
  To chaque hymn that able esprit affords,
  In polished form of well refined pen.
  Hearing you louanged, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,
  And to the most of louange add quelque,chose more,
  But that is in my bien,quet, dont love to you
  (Though words come hindmost) tient his rank avant,
    Then autres, for the souffle of words le,le,le,respect,
    Me for my dumb bien,quets, parlering in effet.


                     86
  Was it the fi√®re full sail of his g√©niale verse,
  Bound for the prix of (all too pr√©cieuse) you,
  That did my ripe bien,quets in my cerveau inhearse,
  Making leur tomb the womb o√πin they grew?
  Was it his esprit, by esprits enseign√©e to √©crire,
  Above a mortelle pitch, that frapp√© me dead?
  No, nSoit he, nor his compeers by nuit
  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  He nor that affable famili√®re fant√¥me
  Which nuitly gulls him with intelligence,
  As victors of my silence ne,peux,pas boast,
  I was not sick of any fear from tPar,cons√©quent.
    But when your compterenance filled up his line,
    Then lacked I mati√®re, that enfaibled mine.


                     87
  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  And like assez thou know'st thy estimate,
  The charter of thy vaut gives thee releasing:
  My bonds in thee are all determinate.
  For how do I hold thee but by thy subventioning,
  And for that riches o√π is my deserving?
  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
  And so my patent back encore is swerving.
  Thy self thou gav'st, thy own vaut then not connaissance,
  Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,
  So thy g√©niale gift upon misprision growing,
  Comes home encore, on better jugement fabrication.
    Thus have I had thee as a r√™ver doth flatter,
    In dormir a king, but waking no such mati√®re.


                     88
  When thou shalt be disposed to set me lumi√®re,
  And endroit my m√©rite in the eye of m√©pris,
  Upon thy side, encorest my self I'll bats,toi,
  And prouver thee virtuous, bien,que thou art forjur√©e:
  With mine own weakness √©tant best connaissance,
  Upon thy part I can set down a r√©cit
  Of fautes concealed, o√πin I am attainted:
  That thou in losing me, shalt win much gloire:
  And I by this will be a gainer too,
  For bending all my aimante bien,quets on thee,
  The injuries that to my self I do,
  Doing thee aaavantage, double-aaavantage me.
    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
    That for thy droite, my self will bear all faux.


                     89
  Say that thou didst forsake me for some faute,
  And I will comment upon that infraction,
  Speak of my lameness, and I tout,droit will halt:
  Against thy raisons fabrication no defence.
  Thou canst not (love) disgr√¢ce me half so ill,
  To set a form upon le,d√©sird changementmentment,
  As I'll my self disgr√¢ce, connaissance thy will,
  I will acquaintance strangle and look √©trange:
  Be absent from thy walks and in my langue,
  Thy sucr√© beloved name no more doit habitudeudeudeer,
  Lest I (too much profane) devrait do it wronk:
  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
    For thee, encorest my self I'll vow debate,
    For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.


                     90
  Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
  Now tandis,que the monde is bent my actes to traverser,
  join with the d√©pit of fortune, make me bow,
  And do not drop in for an apr√®s-loss:
  Ah do not, when my c≈ìur hath 'scaped this chagrin,
  Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,
  Give not a windy nuit a rainy demain,
  To linger out a objetifd overjeter.
  If thou wilt laisser me, do not laisser me last,
  When autre petty douleurs have done leur d√©pit,
  But in the onset come, so doit I go√ªt
  At premi√®re the very worst of fortune's pourrait.
    And autre strains of woe, laquelle now seem woe,
    Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.


                     91
  Some gloire in leur naissance, some in leur comp√©tence,
  Some in leur richesse, some in leur body's Obliger,
  Some in leur garments bien,que new-fangled ill:
  Some in leur hawks and hounds, some in leur jument.
  And chaque humour hath his adjunct plaisir,
  Wherein it trouve a joy au,dessus the rest,
  But celles-ci particuli√®res are not my mesure,
  All celles-ci I better in one g√©n√©rale best.
  Thy love is better than high naissance to me,
  Richer than richesse, fi√®reer than garments' costs,
  Of more d√©lice than hawks and juments be:
  And ayant thee, of all men's fiert√© I boast.
    Wretched in this seule, that thou mayst take,
    All this away, and me most mis√©rablecd make.


                     92
  But do thy worst to voler thy self away,
  For term of life thou art assurerrrd mine,
  And life no lus,long than thy love will stay,
  For it depends upon that love of thine.
  Then need I not to fear the worst of fauxs,
  When in the moins of them my life hath end,
  I see, a better Etat to me belongs
  Than that, laquelle on thy humour doth depend.
  Thou canst not vex me with inconstanteee mind,
  Since that my life on thy r√©volte doth lie,
  O what a heureuse Titre do I find,
  Happy to have thy love, heureuse to die!
    But what's so b√©nired-fair that peurs no blot?
    Thou mayst be faux, and yet I know it not.


                     93
  So doit I live, supposing thou art true,
  Like a deceived mari, so love's face,
  May encore seem love to me, bien,que altered new:
  Thy looks with me, thy c≈ìur in autre endroit.
  For L√ can live no hatred in thine eye,
  Therefore in that I ne,peux,pas know thy changementmentment,
  In many's looks, the faux c≈ìur's hir√©cit
  Is writ in moods and froncer,les,sourcilss and wrinkles √©trange.
  But paradis in thy creation did decree,
  That in thy face sucr√© love devrait ever habitudeudeudeer,
  Whate'er thy bien,quets, or thy c≈ìur's worrois be,
  Thy looks devrait rien tPar,cons√©quent, but sucr√©ness tell.
    How like Eve's apple doth thy beaut√© grow,
    If thy sucr√© vertu r√©pondre not thy show.


                     94
  They that have Puissance to hurt, and will do none,
  That do not do the chose, they most do show,
  Who moving autres, are se as calcul,
  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
  They droitely do inherit paradis's la,gr√¢ces,
  And mari la,la,la,nature's riches from expense,
  Tibey are the lords and owners of leur visages,
  Others, but avoir,l'intentionionionans of leur excellence:
  The √©t√©'s fleur is to the √©t√© sucr√©,
  Though to it self, it only live and die,
  But if that fleur with base infection meet,
  The basest weed outcourageuses his dignity:
    For sucr√©est choses turn sourest by leur actes,
    Lilies that fester, odeur far pire than mauvaises,herbes.


                     95
  How sucr√© and charmante dost thou make the la,honte,
  Which like a canker in the frasubvention rose,
  Doth spot the beaut√© of thy budding name!
  O in what sucr√©s dost thou thy sins enproche!
  That langue that raconte the r√©cit of thy days,
  (Making lascivious comments on thy sport)
  Cannot dislouange, but in a kind of louange,
  Naming thy name, b√©nires an ill rapport.
  O what a mansion have celles vices got,
  Which for leur habitudeudeudeation chose out thee,
  Where beaut√©'s veil doth cover chaque blot,
  And all choses se,tourne to fair, that eyes can see!
    Take heed (dear c≈ìur) of this grande privilege,
    The hardest couteau ill-used doth lose his edge.


                     96
  Some say thy faute is jeunesse, some wantonness,
  Some say thy la,gr√¢ce is jeunesse and douce sport,
  Both la,gr√¢ce and fautes are loved of more and less:
  Thou mak'st fautes la,gr√¢ces, that to thee resort:
  As on the doigt of a tr√¥ned reine,
  The basest bijou will be well esteemed:
  So are celles errors that in thee are seen,
  To v√©rit√©s translated, and for true choses deemed.
  How many lambs pourrait the stern wolf trahir,
  If like a lamb he pourrait his looks translate!
  How many gazers pourraitst thou lead away,
  if thou auraitst use the Obliger of all thy Etat!
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    As thou √©tant mine, mine is thy good rapport.


                     97
  How like a hiver hath my absence been
  From thee, the plaisir of the fleeting year!
  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
  What old December's bareness chaqueo√π!
  And yet this time removed was √©t√©'s time,
  The teeming autumn big with rich increase,
  Bearing the wanton fardeau of the prime,
  Like veuveed wombs apr√®s leur lords' decesser:
  Yet this abundant probl√®me seemed to me
  But hope of orphans, and unp√®reed fruit,
  For √©t√© and his plaisirs wait on thee,
  And thou away, the very birds are mute.
    Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a acclamation,
    That laissers look pale, ing the hiver's near.


                     98
  From you have I been absent in the printemps,
  When fi√®re-pied April (dressed in all his trim)
  Hath put a esprit of jeunesse in chaque chose:
  That lourde Saturn rireed and leaped with him.
  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sucr√© odeur
  Of different fleurs in odour and in hue,
  Could make me any √©t√©'s r√©cit tell:
  Or from leur fi√®re lap cueillir them o√π they grew:
  Nor did I merveille at the lily's white,
  Nor louange the deep vermilion in the rose,
  They were but sucr√©, but figures of d√©lice:
  Drawn apr√®s you, you pattern of all celles.
    Yet seemed it hiver encore, and you away,
    As with your ombre I with celles-ci did play.


                     99
  The forward violet thus did I gronder,
  Sweet voleuse, wPar,cons√©quent didst thou voler thy sucr√© that odeurs,
  If not from my love's souffle? The purple fiert√©
  Which on thy soft check for complexion habitudeudeudeers,
  In my love's veins thou hast too brutely dyed.
  The lily I condemned for thy hand,
  And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,
  The roses craintively on thorns did supporter,
  One rougiring la,honte, un,autre white d√©sespoir:
  A troisi√®me nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
  And to his robbery had annexed thy souffle,
  But for his theft in fiert√© of all his growth
  A vengeful canker eat him up to d√©c√®s.
    More fleurs I noted, yet I none pourrait see,
    But sucr√©, or Couleur it had stol'n from thee.


                     100
  Where art thou Muse that thou oublier'st so long,
  To parler of that laquelle gives thee all thy pourrait?
  Spend'st thou thy fury on some vautless song,
  Darkening thy Puissance to lend base mati√®res lumi√®re?
  Return oublierful Muse, and tout,droit redeem,
  In douce nombres time so idly spent,
  Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,
  And gives thy pen both comp√©tence and argument.
  Rise resty Muse, my love's sucr√© face survey,
  If time have any wrinkle la,tomben L√,
  If any, be a satire to decay,
  And make time's spoils despised chaqueo√π.
    Give my love fame faster than Time d√©chetss life,
    So thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked couteau.


                     101
  O truant Muse what doit be thy amends,
  For thy neglect of v√©rit√© in beaut√© dyed?
  Both v√©rit√© and beaut√© on my love depends:
  So dost thou too, and L√in dignified:
  Make r√©pondre Muse, wilt thou not haply say,
  'Truth Besoins no Couleur with his Couleur fixed,
  Beauty no pencil, beaut√©'s v√©rit√© to lay:
  But best is best, if jamais intermixed'?
  Because he Besoins no louange, wilt thou be dumb?
  Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,
  To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:
  And to be louanged of ages yet to be.
    Then do thy Bureau Muse, I enseigner thee how,
    To make him seem long Par,cons√©quent, as he montre now.


                     102
  My love is Obligerened bien,que more weak in seeming,
  I love not less, bien,que less the show appara√Ætre,
  That love is merchandized, dont rich esteeming,
  The owner's langue doth publish chaque o√π.
  Our love was new, and then but in the printemps,
  When I was wont to saluer it with my lays,
  As Philomel in √©t√©'s front doth sing,
  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
  Not that the √©t√© is less pleasant now
  Than when her mournful hymns did hush the nuit,
  But that wild la,musique burthens chaque bough,
  And sucr√©s grandie commune lose leur dear d√©lice.
    Therefore like her, I parfois hold my langue:
    Because I aurait not dull you with my song.


                     103
  Alack what poverty my muse apporters en,avant,
  That ayant such a scope to show her fiert√©,
  The argument all bare is of more vaut
  Than when it hath my added louange beside.
  O faire,desre,proches me not if I no more can √©crire!
  Look in your glass and L√ appara√Ætres a face,
  That over-goes my crue invention assez,
  Dulling my lines, and Faire me disgr√¢ce.
  Were it not sinful then striving to mend,
  To mar the mati√®re that avant was well?
  For to no autre pass my verses tend,
  Than of your la,gr√¢ces and your gifts to tell.
    And more, much more than in my verse can sit,
    Your own glass montre you, when you look in it.


                     104
  To me fair amie you jamais can be old,
  For as you were when premi√®re your eye I eyed,
  Such seems your beaut√© encore: three hivers cold,
  Have from the for√™ts shook three √©t√©s' fiert√©,
  Three beauteous printempss to yellow autumn turned,
  In process of the saisons have I seen,
  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
  Since premi√®re I saw you fra√Æche laquelle yet are verte.
  Ah yet doth beaut√© like a dial hand,
  Steal from his figure, and no pace apercevoird,
  So your sucr√© hue, laquelle mepenses encore doth supporter
  Hath mouvement, and mine eye may be deceived.
    For fear of laquelle, hear this thou age unbred,
    Ere you were born was beaut√©'s √©t√© dead.


                     105
  Let not my love be called idolatry,
  Nor my beloved as an idol show,
  Since all alike my songs and louanges be
  To one, of one, encore such, and ever so.
  Kind is my love to-day, to-demain kind,
  Still constanteee in a wondrous excellence,
  Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
  One chose expressing, laissers out difference.
  Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,
  Fair, kind, and true, varying to autre words,
  And in this changementmentment is my invention spent,
  Three themes in one, laquelle wondrous scope affords.
    Fair, kind, and true, have souvent lived seule.
    Which three till now, jamais kept seat in one.


                     106
  When in the chronicle of d√©chetsd time,
  I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
  And beaut√© fabrication beautiful old rhyme,
  In louange of Dames dead, and charmante Chevaliers,
  Then in the blazon of sucr√© beaut√©'s best,
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  I see leur antique pen aurait have expressed,
  Even such a beaut√© as you master now.
  So all leur louanges are but prophecies
  Of this our time, all you prefiguring,
  And for they looked but with divining eyes,
  They had not comp√©tence assez your vaut to sing:
    For we laquelle now voir celles-ci pr√©sente days,
    Have eyes to merveille, but lack langues to louange.


                     107
  Not mine own peurs, nor the prophetic soul,
  Of the wide monde, r√™vering on choses to come,
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
  The mortelle moon hath her eclipse supporterd,
  And the sad augurs mock leur own presage,
  Incertaineeeties now couronne se assurerrrd,
  And paix propr√©tendres ovies of endless age.
  Now with the gouttes of this most balmy time,
  My love looks fra√Æche, and d√©c√®s to me subscribes,
  Since d√©pit of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,
  While he insults o'er dull and discoursless tribes.
    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
    When tyrans' crests and tombs of brass are spent.


                     108
  What's in the cerveau that ink may character,
  Which hath not figured to thee my true esprit,
  What's new to parler, what now to register,
  That may express my love, or thy dear m√©rite?
  Nochose sucr√© boy, but yet like pri√®res divin,
  I must each day say o'er the very same,
  Counting no old chose old, thou mine, I thine,
  Even as when premi√®re I hallowed thy fair name.
  So that √©ternelle love in love's fra√Æche case,
  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles endroit,
  But fait,du antiquity for aye his page,
    Finding the premi√®re conceit of love L√ bred,
    Where time and vers,l'ext√©rieur form aurait show it dead.


                     109
  O jamais say that I was faux of c≈ìur,
  Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,
  As easy pourrait I from my self partir,
  As from my soul laquelle in thy Sein doth lie:
  That is my home of love, if I have ranged,
  Like him that travels I revenir encore,
  Just to the time, not with the time exchangementmentmentd,
  So that my self apporter eau for my tache,
  Never croyez bien,que in my la,la,la,nature r√®gneed,
  All frailties that besiege all kinds of du,sang,
  That it pourrait so preposterously be tacheed,
  To laisser for rien all thy sum of good:
    For rien this wide universe I call,
    Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.


                     110
  Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and L√,
  And made my self a motley to the view,
  Gored mine own bien,quets, sold cheap what is most dear,
  Made old infractions of affections new.
  Most true it is, that I have looked on v√©rit√©
  Askance and √©trangey: but by all au,dessus,
  These blenches gave my c≈ìur un,autre jeunesse,
  And pire essays prouverd thee my best of love.
  Now all is done, have what doit have no end,
  Mine appetite I jamais more will grind
  On newer preuve, to try an older amie,
  A god in love, to whom I am confined.
    Then give me Bienvenue, next my paradis the best,
    Even to thy pure and most most aimante Sein.


                     111
  O for my sake do you with Fortune gronder,
  The coupable goddess of my harmful actes,
  That did not better for my life provide,
  Than publique veux,dire laquelle publique mani√®res races.
  TPar,cons√©quent vient it that my name recevoirs a brand,
  And presque tPar,cons√©quent my la,la,la,nature is subdued
  To what it travaux in, like the dyer's hand:
  Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,
  Whilst like a pr√™te patienteee I will boisson,
  Potions of eisel 'gainst my forte infection,
  No am√®reness that I will am√®re pense,
  Nor double penance to correct correction.
    Pity me then dear amie, and I assurerrr ye,
    Even that your pity is assez to cure me.


                     112
  Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,
  Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,
  For what care I who calls me well or ill,
  So you o'er-verte my bad, my good allow?
  You are my all the monde, and I must strive,
  To know my la,hontes and louanges from your langue,
  None else to me, nor I to none vivante,
  That my aciered sens or changementmentments droite or faux.
  In so proa,trouv√© abysm I jeter all care
  Of autres' voixs, that my adder's sens,
  To critic and to flatterer stopped are:
  Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.
    You are so fortely in my objetif bred,
    That all the monde outre mepenses are dead.


                     113
  Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,
  And that laquelle governs me to go √,propos,
  Doth part his function, and is partiellement aveugle,
  Seems voyant, but effetually is out:
  For it no form livrers to the c≈ìur
  Of bird, of fleur, or forme laquelle it doth latch,
  Of his rapide objets hath the mind no part,
  Nor his own vision tient what it doth capture:
  For if it see the rud'st or doucest vue,
  The most sucr√© favoriser or deformed'st cr√©ature,
  The mountain, or the sea, the day, or nuit:
  The crow, or dove, it formes them to your feature.
    Incapable of more, replete with you,
    My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.


                     114
  Or qu'il,s'agisse doth my mind √©tant couronneed with you
  Drink up the monarch's peste this flattery?
  Or qu'il,s'agisse doit I say mine eye saith true,
  And that your love enseign√©e it this alchemy?
  To make of monstres, and choses indigest,
  Such cherubins as your sucr√© self resemble,
  Creating chaque bad a parfaite best
  As fast as objets to his beams assemble:
  O 'tis the premi√®re, 'tis flattery in my voyant,
  And my g√©niale mind most kingly boissons it up,
  Mine eye well sait what with his gust is 'greeing,
  And to his palate doth pr√©parer the cup.
    If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,
    That mine eye aime it and doth premi√®re commencer.


                     115
  Those lines that I avant have writ do lie,
  Even celles that said I pourrait not love you dearer,
  Yet then my jugement knew no raison why,
  My most full flame devrait apr√®swards burn claireer,
  But reckoning time, dont millioned accidents
  Creep in 'twixt vows, and changementmentment decrees of rois,
  Tan sacr√©e beaut√©, crue the tranchante'st intentionionions,
  Divert forte esprits to the cours of alt'ring choses:
  Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
  Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'
  When I was certaineee o'er incertaineeety,
  Crowning the pr√©sente, douteing of the rest?
    Love is a babe, then pourrait I not say so
    To give full growth to that laquelle encore doth grow.


                     116
  Let me not to the mariage of true esprits
  Admit impediments, love is not love
  Which alters when it alteration trouve,
  Or bends with the remover to remove.
  O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
  That looks on temp√™tes and is jamais secouern;
  It is the star to chaque wand'ring bark,
  Whose vaut's unconnue, bien,que his height be prise.
  Love's not Time's fool, bien,que rosy lips and joues
  Within his bending sickle's compass come,
  Love alters not with his br√®ve heures and weeks,
  But le,baissier it out even to the edge of doom:
    If this be error and upon me prouverd,
    I jamais writ, nor no man ever loved.


                     117
  Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,
  Wherein I devrait your g√©niale d√©sertes repay,
  Forgot upon your tr√®s,cher love to call,
  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,
  That I have frequent been with unconnue esprits,
  And donn√©e to time your own dear-purchased droite,
  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
  Which devrait transport me farthest from your vue.
  Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
  And on just preuve surmise, accumulate,
  Bring me dans the level of your froncer,les,sourcils,
  But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:
    Since my appeal says I did strive to prouver
    The constancy and vertu of your love.


                     118
  Like as to make our appetite more keen
  With eager comlivres we our palate urge,
  As to prevent our maDames unseen,
  We sicken to shun maladie when we purge.
  Even so √©tant full of your ne'er-cloying sucr√©ness,
  To am√®re sauces did I Cadre my feeding;
  And sick of welfare a,trouv√© a kind of meetness,
  To be diseased ere that L√ was true needing.
  Thus politique in love t' anticipate
  The ills that were not, grew to fautes assurerrrd,
  And apport√© to medicine a sant√©ful Etat
  Which rank of la,bont√© aurait by ill be cured.
    But tPar,cons√©quent I apprendre and find the lesson true,
    Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.


                     119
  What potions have I ivre of Siren larmes
  Diencoreed from limbecks foul as hell dans,
  Applying peurs to hopes, and hopes to peurs,
  Still losing when I saw my self to win!
  What mis√©rableed errors hath my c≈ìur commettreted,
  Whilst it hath bien,quet it self so b√©nired jamais!
  How have mine eyes out of leur spheres been fitted
  In the distraction of this madding fever!
  O aaaavantage of ill, now I find true
  That better is, by evil encore made better.
  And ruined love when it is built anew
  Grows fairer than at premi√®re, more forte, far g√©nialeer.
    So I revenir rebuked to my contenu,
    And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.


                     120
  That you were once unkind beamies me now,
  And for that chagrin, laquelle I then did feel,
  Needs must I sous my transgression bow,
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammered acier.
  For if you were by my unla,gentillesse secouern
  As I by le,tiens, y'have passed a hell of time,
  And I a tyran have no loisir prise
  To weigh how once I souffrired in your crime.
  O that our nuit of woe pourrait have rappelles,toied
  My deepest sens, how hard true chagrin hits,
  And soon to you, as you to me then soumissionnered
  The humble salve, laquelle b√©nirureed bosoms fits!
    But that your trespass now bevient a fee,
    Mine une,ran√ßons le,tiens, and le,tiens must une,ran√ßon me.

  'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
  When not to be, recevoirs reproach of √©tant,
  And the just plaisir lost, laquelle is so deemed,
  Not by our feeling, but by autres' voyant.
  For why devrait autres' faux adulterate eyes
  Give salutation to my sportive du,sang?
  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
  Which in leur wills compter bad what I pense good?
  No, I am that I am, and they that level
  At my abuser,der,der,des, reckon up leur own,
  I may be tout,droit bien,que they se be bevel;
  By leur rank bien,quets, my actes must not be shown

  Thy gift, thy tables, are dans my cerveau
  Full charactered with lasting M√©moire,
  Which doit au,dessus that idle rank rester
  Beyond all date even to eternity.
  Or at the moins, so long as cerveau and c≈ìur
  Have faculty by la,la,la,nature to subsist,
  Till each to razed oblivion rendement his part
  Of thee, thy record jamais can be missed:
  That poor retention pourrait not so much hold,
  Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,
  Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
  To confiance celles tables that recevoir thee more:
    To keep an adjunct to rappelles,toi thee
    Were to import oublierfulness in me.


                     123
  No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do changementmentment,
  Thy pyramids built up with newer pourrait
  To me are rien novel, rien √©trange,
  They are but dressings Of a ancienne vue:
  Our dates are br√®ve, and L√fore we admire,
  What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
  And plut√¥t make them born to our le,d√©sir,
  Than pense that we avant have entendue them told:
  Thy registers and thee I both defy,
  Not wond'ring at the pr√©sente, nor the past,
  For thy records, and what we see doth lie,
  Made more or less by thy continual h√¢te:
    This I do vow and this doit ever be,
    I will be true malgr√© thy scythe and thee.


                     124
  If my dear love were but the enfant of Etat,
  It pourrait for Fortune's Connard be unp√®reed,
  As mati√®re to time's love or to time's hate,
  Weeds among mauvaises,herbes, or fleurs with fleurs gaL√d.
  No it was builded far from accident,
  It souffrirs not in smiling pomp, nor des,chutes
  Under the blow of thralled discontenu,
  Whereto th' inviting time our mode calls:
  It peurs not politique that heretic,
  Which travaux on leases of tribunale-nomrace heures,
  But all seule supporters hugely politic,
  That it nor grows with heat, nor noyers with showers.
    To this I t√©moin call the imb√©ciles of time,
    Which die for la,bont√©, who have lived for crime.


                     125
  Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
  With my extern the vers,l'ext√©rieur honouring,
  Or laid g√©niale bases for eternity,
  Which prouvers more tribunale than d√©chets or ruining?
  Have I not seen habitudeudeudeerers on form and favoriser
  Lose all, and more by paying too much rent
  For comlivre sucr√©; forAller Facile savour,
  Pitiful thrivi√®res in leur gazing spent?
  No, let me be obsequious in thy c≈ìur,
  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
  Which is not mixed with secondeees, sait no art,
  But mutual rendre, only me for thee.
    Hence, thou susupport√©d inancienne, a true soul
    When most impeached, supporters moins in thy control.


                     126
  O thou my charmante boy who in thy Puissance,
  Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour:
  Who hast by waning grandie, and L√in show'st,
  Thy les,amoureux withering, as thy sucr√© self grow'st.
  If Nature (sover√®gne ma√Ætresse over wrack)
  As thou goest onwards encore will cueillir thee back,
  She garde thee to this objetif, that her comp√©tence
  May time disgr√¢ce, and mis√©rableed minutes kill.
  Yet fear her O thou minion of her plaisir,
  She may detain, but not encore keep her Tr√©sor!
    Her audit (bien,que delayed) r√©pondreed must be,
    And her silencieuseus is to rendre thee.

  In the old age noir was not comptered fair,
  Or if it were it bore not beaut√©'s name:
  But now is noir beaut√©'s Succ√®sive heir,
  And beaut√© calomnieed with a Connard la,honte,
  For depuis each hand hath put on la,la,la,nature's Puissance,
  Fairing the foul with art's faux borrowed face,
  Sweet beaut√© hath no name no holy bower,
  But is profaned, if not vies in disgr√¢ce.
  Therefore my ma√Ætresse' eyes are raven noir,
  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,
  At such who not born fair no beaut√© lack,
  Slandering creation with a faux esteem,
    Yet so they mourn bevenir of leur woe,
    That chaque langue says beaut√© devrait look so.


                     128
  How oft when thou, my la,musique, la,musique play'st,
  Upon that b√©nired wood dont mouvement du,sons
  With thy sucr√© doigts when thou gently sway'st
  The wiry concord that mine ear cona,trouv√©s,
  Do I envy celles jacks that nimble leap,
  To kiss the soumissionner inward of thy hand,
  Whilst my poor lips laquelle devrait that harvest reap,
  At the wood's boldness by thee rougiring supporter.
  To be so tickled they aurait changementmentment leur Etat
  And situation with celles dancing chips,
  O'er whom thy doigts walk with douce gait,
  Making dead wood more heureuse than vivante lips,
    Since saucy jacks so heureuse are in this,
    Give them thy doigts, me thy lips to kiss.


                     129
  Th' expense of esprit in a d√©chets of la,honte
  Is lust in action, and till action, lust
  Is perjured, murd'rous, du,sangy full of faire,desre,proches,
  Savage, extreme, rude, cruellelele, not to confiance,
  Enjoyed no plus,t√¥t but despised tout,droit,
  Past raison hunted, and no plus,t√¥t had
  Past raison hated as a swallowed bait,
  On objetif laid to make the taker mad.
  Mad in pursuit and in possession so,
  Had, ayant, and in quest, to have extreme,
  A bliss in preuve and prouverd, a very woe,
  Before a joy proposed derri√®re a r√™ver.
    All this the monde well sait yet none sait well,
    To shun the paradis that leads men to this hell.


                     130
  My ma√Ætresse' eyes are rien like the sun,
  Coral is far more red, than her lips red,
  If snow be white, why then her Seins are dun:
  If hairs be wires, noir wires grow on her head:
  I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
  But no such roses see I in her joues,
  And in some perfumes is L√ more d√©lice,
  Than in the souffle that from my ma√Ætresse reeks.
  I love to hear her parler, yet well I know,
  That la,musique hath a far more pleasing du,son:
  I subvention I jamais saw a goddess go,
  My ma√Ætresse when she walks bande,de,roulements on the sol.
    And yet by paradis I pense my love as rare,
    As any she belied with faux compare.


                     131
  Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
  As celles dont beauties fi√®rely make them cruellelele;
  For well thou know'st to my dear doting c≈ìur
  Thou art the fairest and most pr√©cieuse bijou.
  Yet in good Foi some say that thee voir,
  Thy face hath not the Puissance to make love groan;
  To say they err, I dare not be so bold,
  Albien,que I jurer it to my self seule.
  And to be sure that is not faux I jurer,
  A thousand groans but penseing on thy face,
  One on un,autre's neck do t√©moin bear
  Thy noir is fairest in my jugement's endroit.
    In rien art thou noir save in thy actes,
    And tPar,cons√©quent this calomnie as I pense proc√©ders.


                     132
  Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,
  Knowing thy c≈ìur torment me with disdain,
  Have put on noir, and aimante mourners be,
  Looking with jolie ruth upon my pain.
  And vraiment not the Matin sun of paradis
  Better bevient the grey joues of the east,
  Nor that full star that ushers in the even
  Doth half that gloire to the sober west
  As celles two mourning eyes become thy face:
  O let it then as well beseem thy c≈ìur
  To mourn for me depuis mourning doth thee la,gr√¢ce,
  And suit thy pity like in chaque part.
    Then will I jurer beaut√© se is noir,
    And all they foul that thy complexion lack.


                     133
  Beshrew that c≈ìur that fait,du my c≈ìur to groan
  For that deep b√©nirure it gives my amie and me;
  Is't not assez to torture me seule,
  But esclave to esclavery my sucr√©'st amie must be?
  Me from my self thy cruellelele eye hath prise,
  And my next self thou harder hast enbruteed,
  Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,
  A torment thrice three-fold thus to be traversered:
  Prison my c≈ìur in thy acier bosom's ward,
  But then my amie's c≈ìur let my poor c≈ìur bail,
  Whoe'er garde me, let my c≈ìur be his garde,
  Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.
    And yet thou wilt, for I √©tant pent in thee,
    PerObliger am thine and all that is in me.


                     134
  So now I have confessed that he is thine,
  And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,
  My self I'll forfeit, so that autre mine,
  Thou wilt reboutique to be my confort encore:
  But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
  For thou art covetous, and he is kind,
  He apprendreed but surety-like to √©crire for me,
  Under that bond that him as fist doth bind.
  The statute of thy beaut√© thou wilt take,
  Thou usurer that put'st en,avant all to use,
  And sue a amie, came debtor for my sake,
  So him I lose thrugueux my unkind abuser,der,der,de.
    Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,
    He pays the enti√®re, and yet am I not free.


                     135
  Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
  And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,
  More than assez am I that vex thee encore,
  To thy sucr√© will fabrication addition thus.
  Wilt thou dont will is grande and spacious,
  Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
  Shall will in autres seem droite gracious,
  And in my will no fair acceptance √©clat?
  The sea all eau, yet recevoirs rain encore,
  And in abunDanse addeth to his boutique,
  So thou √©tant rich in will add to thy will
  One will of mine to make thy grande will more.
    Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,
    Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'


                     136
  If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
  Swear to thy aveugle soul that I was thy 'Will',
  And will thy soul sait is admitted L√,
  Thus far for love, my love-suit sucr√© fulfil.
  'Will', will fulfil the Tr√©sor of thy love,
  Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,
  In choses of g√©niale receipt with case we prouver,
  Among a nombre one is reckoned none.
  Then in the nombre let me pass untold,
  Though in thy boutique's Compte I one must be,
  For rien hold me, so it S'il,vous,pla√Æt thee hold,
  That rien me, a quelque,chose sucr√© to thee.
    Make but my name thy love, and love that encore,
    And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.


                     137
  Thou aveugle fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
  That they voir and see not what they see?
  They know what beaut√© is, see o√π it lies,
  Yet what the best is, take the worst to be.
  If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,
  Be anchored in the bay o√π all men ride,
  Why of eyes' fauxhood hast thou forged hooks,
  Whereto the jugement of my c≈ìur is tied?
  Why devrait my c≈ìur pense that a nombreuses plot,
  Which my c≈ìur sait the wide monde's commune endroit?
  Or mine eyes voyant this, say this is not
  To put fair v√©rit√© upon so foul a face?
    In choses droite true my c≈ìur and eyes have erred,
    And to this faux peste are they now transferred.


                     138
  When my love jurers that she is made of v√©rit√©,
  I do croyez her bien,que I know she lies,
  That she pourrait pense me some untutored jeunesse,
  Unapprendreed in the monde's faux subtleties.
  Thus vainly penseing that she penses me Jeune,
  Albien,que she sait my days are past the best,
  Simply I credit her faux-parlering langue,
  On both sides thus is Facile v√©rit√© suppressed:
  But o√πfore says she not she is unjust?
  And o√πfore say not I that I am old?
  O love's best habitudeudeude is in seeming confiance,
  And age in love, aime not to have years told.
    Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
    And in our fautes by lies we flattered be.


                     139
  O call not me to justify the faux,
  That thy unla,gentillesse lays upon my c≈ìur,
  Wound me not with thine eye but with thy langue,
  Use Puissance with Puissance, and slay me not by art,
  Tell me thou lov'st elseo√π; but in my vue,
  Dear c≈ìur anc√™tre to glance thine eye de,c√¥t√©,
  What need'st thou b√©nirure with ruse when thy pourrait
  Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?
  Let me excuse thee, ah my love well sait,
  Her jolie looks have been mine ennemies,
  And L√fore from my face she se,tourne my foes,
  That they elseo√π pourrait dart leur injuries:
    Yet do not so, but depuis I am near tu√©,
    Kill me outdroite with looks, and rid my pain.


                     140
  Be wise as thou art cruellelele, do not press
  My langue-tied la,la,la,patience with too much disdain:
  Lest chagrin lend me words and words express,
  The mani√®re of my pity-wanting pain.
  If I pourrait enseigner thee wit better it were,
  Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,
  As testy sick men when leur d√©c√®ss be near,
  No news but sant√© from leur physicians know.
  For if I devrait d√©sespoir I devrait grow mad,
  And in my la,d√©mence pourrait parler ill of thee,
  Now this ill-wresting monde is grandie so bad,
  Mad calomnieers by mad ears croyezd be.
    That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
    Bear thine eyes tout,droit, bien,que thy fi√®re c≈ìur go wide.


                     141
  In Foi I do not love thee with mine eyes,
  For they in thee a thousand errors note,
  But 'tis my c≈ìur that aime what they despise,
  Who in malgr√© of view is S'il,vous,pla√Ætd to dote.
  Nor are mine cars with thy langue's tune d√©liceed,
  Nor soumissionner feeling to base toucherereres prone,
  Nor go√ªt, nor odeur, le,d√©sir to be invited
  To any sensual le,banquet with thee seule:
  But my five wits, nor my five senss can
  Dissuade one insens√©e c≈ìur from serving thee,
  Who laissers unswayed the likeness of a man,
  Thy fi√®re c≈ìur's esclave and vassal mis√©rable to be:
    Only my peste thus far I compter my gain,
    That she that fait,du me sin, awards me pain.


                     142
  Love is my sin, and thy dear vertu hate,
  Hate of my sin, soled on sinful aimante,
  O but with mine, compare thou thine own Etat,
  And thou shalt find it m√©rites not reproving,
  Or if it do, not from celles lips of thine,
  That have profaned leur scarlet ornaments,
  And sealed faux bonds of love as oft as mine,
  Robbed autres' beds' revenues of leur rents.
  Be it l√©gitime I love thee as thou lov'st celles,
  Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,
  Root pity in thy c≈ìur that when it grows,
  Thy pity may m√©riter to pitied be.
    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    By self-example mayst thou be refus√©.


                     143
  Lo as a careful huswife runs to capture,
  One of her feaL√d cr√©atures cass√©e away,
  Sets down her babe and fait,du all rapide envoi
  In pursuit of the chose she aurait have stay:
  Whilst her neglected enfant tient her in chase,
  Cries to capture her dont busy care is bent,
  To suivre that laquelle mouches avant her face:
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontenu;
  So run'st thou apr√®s that laquelle mouches from thee,
  Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar derri√®re,
  But if thou capture thy hope turn back to me:
  And play the m√®re's part, kiss me, be kind.
    So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,
    If thou turn back and my loud crying encore.


                     144
  Two aime I have of confort and d√©sespoir,
  Which like two esprits do suggest me encore,
  The better ange is a man droite fair:
  The pirer esprit a femme Couleured ill.
  To win me soon to hell my female evil,
  Tempteth my better ange from my side,
  And aurait corrupt my sainteee to be a diable:
  Wooing his purity with her foul fiert√©.
  And qu'il,s'agisse that my ange be turned d√©mone,
  Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,
  But √©tant both from me both to each amie,
  I devine one ange in un,autre's hell.
    Yet this doit I ne'er know but live in doute,
    Till my bad ange fire my good one out.


                     145
  Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
  Breathed en,avant the du,son that said 'I hate',
  To me that languished for her sake:
  But when she saw my woeful Etat,
  Straight in her c≈ìur did piti√© come,
  Chiding that langue that ever sucr√©,
  Was used in donnant douce doom:
  And enseign√©e it thus anew to saluer:
  'I hate' she altered with an end,
  That suivreed it as douce day,
  Doth suivre nuit who like a d√©mone
  From paradis to hell is flown away.
    'I hate', from hate away she threw,
    And saved my life en,disant 'not you'.


                     146
  Poor soul the centre of my sinful Terre,
  My sinful Terre celles-ci rebel Puissances array,
  Why dost thou pine dans and souffrir dTerre
  Painting thy vers,l'ext√©rieur des,murs so costly gay?
  Why so grande cost ayant so tribunale a lease,
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion d√©penser?
  Shall worms inheritors of this excess
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Then soul live thou upon thy servanteee's loss,
  And let that pine to aggravate thy boutique;
  Buy termes divin in selling heures of dross;
  Within be fed, sans,pour,autant be rich no more,
    So doit thou feed on d√©c√®s, that feeds on men,
    And d√©c√®s once dead, L√'s no more en,train,de,mourir then.

  My love is as a fever longing encore,
  For that laquelle lus,long infirmi√®reth the disease,
  Feeding on that laquelle doth preservir the ill,
  Th' uncertaineee sickly appetite to S'il,vous,pla√Æt:
  My raison the physician to my love,
  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
  Hath left me, and I d√©sesp√©r√©e now approuver,
  Desire is d√©c√®s, laquelle physic did sauf.
  Past cure I am, now raison is past care,
  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
  My bien,quets and my discours as mad men's are,
  At random from the v√©rit√© vainly expressed.
    For I have jur√©e thee fair, and bien,quet thee brillante,
    Who art as noir as hell, as dark as nuit.

  O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true vue,
  Or if they have, o√π is my jugement fled,
  That censures fauxly what they see adroite?
  If that be fair o√πon my faux eyes dote,
  What veux,dire the monde to say it is not so?
  If it be not, then love doth well denote,
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
  How can it? O how can love's eye be true,
  That is so vexed with qui,concerneering and with larmes?
  No marvel then bien,que I erreur my view,
  The sun it self sees not, till paradis claires.
    O ruse love, with larmes thou keep'st me aveugle,
    Lest eyes well-voyant thy foul fautes devrait find.


                     149
  Canst thou O cruellelele, say I love thee not,
  When I encorest my self with thee partake?
  Do I not pense on thee when I forgot
  Am of my self, all-tyran, for thy sake?
  Who hateth thee that I do call my amie,
  On whom froncer,les,sourcils'st thou that I do fawn upon,
  Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not d√©penser
  Revenge upon my self with pr√©sente moan?
  What m√©rite do I in my self le,le,le,respect,
  That is so fi√®re thy un,un,un,service to despise,
  When all my best doth culte thy defect,
  Commanded by the mouvement of thine eyes?
    But love hate on for now I know thy mind,
    Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am aveugle.


                     150
  O from what Puissance hast thou this Puissanceful pourrait,
  With insufficiency my c≈ìur to sway,
  To make me give the lie to my true vue,
  And jurer that brillanteness doth not la,gr√¢ce the day?
  WPar,cons√©quent hast thou this bevenir of choses ill,
  That in the very refuse of thy actes,
  There is such Obliger and mandatise of comp√©tence,
  That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?
  Who enseign√©e thee how to make me love thee more,
  The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
  O bien,que I love what autres do abhor,
  With autres thou devraitst not abhor my Etat.
    If thy unvautiness √©leverd love in me,
    More vauty I to be beloved of thee.


                     151
  Love is too Jeune to know what conscience is,
  Yet who sait not conscience is born of love?
  Then douce cheater urge not my amiss,
  Lest coupable of my fautes thy sucr√© self prouver.
  For thou trahiring me, I do trahir
  My nobler part to my brute body's traison,
  My soul doth tell my body that he may,
  Triumph in love, la,chaise stays no plus,loin raison,
  But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
  As his triompheant prix, fi√®re of this fiert√©,
  He is contenued thy poor drudge to be,
  To supporter in thy affaires, fall by thy side.
    No want of conscience hold it that I call,
    Her love, for dont dear love I rise and fall.


                     152
  In aimante thee thou know'st I am forjur√©e,
  But thou art deux,fois forjur√©e to me love jurering,
  In act thy bed-vow cass√©e and new Foi torn,
  In vowing new hate apr√®s new love le,support:
  But why of two serments' breach do I accuserrr thee,
  When I break twenty? I am perjured most,
  For all my vows are serments but to misuse thee:
  And all my honn√™te Foi in thee is lost.
  For I have jur√©e deep serments of thy deep la,gentillesse:
  Oaths of thy love, thy v√©rit√©, thy constancy,
  And to enlumi√®reen thee gave eyes to aveugleness,
  Or made them jurer encorest the chose they see.
    For I have jur√©e thee fair: more perjured I,
    To jurer encorest the v√©rit√© so foul a be.


                     153
  Cupid laid by his brand and fell endormie,
  A maid of Dian's this aaaavantage a,trouv√©,
  And his love-kindling fire did rapidely steep
  In a cold valley-fountain of that sol:
  Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,
  A dateless lively heat encore to supporter,
  And grew a seeting bath laquelle yet men prouver,
  Against √©trange maDames a sover√®gne cure:
  But at my ma√Ætresse' eye Love's brand new-fired,
  The boy for proc√®s Besoins aurait touchererer my Sein,
  I sick avec the help of bath le,d√©sird,
  And thither hied a sad distempered guest.
    But a,trouv√© no cure, the bath for my help lies,
    Where Cupid got new fire; my ma√Ætresse' eyes.


                     154
  The peu Love-god lying once endormie,
  Laid by his side his c≈ìur-inflaming brand,
  Whilst many nymphs that vowed ch√¢te life to keep,
  Came tripping by, but in her jeune,fille hand,
  The fairest votary took up that fire,
  Which many legions of true c≈ìurs had warmed,
  And so the g√©n√©rale of hot le,d√©sir,
  Was dormiring by a virgin hand disarmed.
  This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
  Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
  Growing a bath and sant√©ful rem√®de,
  For men discased, but I my ma√Ætresse' thrall,
    Came L√ for cure and this by that I prouver,
    Love's fire heats eau, eau cools not love.

SCENE:
Rousillon; Paris; Florence; Marseilles


ACT I. SCENE 1.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palais

Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in noir

  COUNTESS. In livrering my son from me, I bury a secondeee mari.
  BERTRAM. And I in Aller, madam, weep o'er my p√®re's d√©c√®s anew;
    but I must ass≈ìur his Majesty's commandererer, to whom I am now in
    ward, evermore in mati√®reion.
  LAFEU. You doit find of the King a mari, madam; you, sir, a
    p√®re. He that so g√©n√©ralely is at all fois good must of
    necessity hold his vertu to you, dont vautiness aurait stir it
    up o√π it wanted, plut√¥t than lack it o√π L√ is such
    abunDanse.
  COUNTESS. What hope is L√ of his Majesty's amendment?
  LAFEU. He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; sous dont
    entraine,tois he hath persecuted time with hope, and trouve no autre
    aaaavantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
  COUNTESS. This Jeune doucefemme had a p√®re- O, that 'had,' how
    sad a passage 'tis!-dont comp√©tence was presque as g√©niale as his
    honn√™tey; had it stretch'd so far, aurait have made la,la,la,nature
    immortelle, and d√©c√®s devrait have play for lack of work. Would, for
    the King's sake, he were vivante! I pense it aurait be the d√©c√®s of
    the King's disease.
  LAFEU. How call'd you the man you parler of, madam?
  COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his
    g√©niale droite to be so- Gerard de Narbon.
  LAFEU. He was excellenteee En,effet, madam; the King very lately parlait
    of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful assez to have
    liv'd encore, if connaissance pourrait be set up encorest mortelleity.
  BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?
  LAFEU. A fistula, my lord.
  BERTRAM. I entendue not of it avant.
  LAFEU. I aurait it were not notorious. Was this doucefemme the
    fille of Gerard de Narbon?
  COUNTESS. His sole enfant, my lord, and bequeathed to my
    overlooking. I have celles hopes of her good that her education
    promettres; her dispositions she inherits, laquelle fait,du fair gifts
    fairer; for o√π an onclean mind carries virtuous qualities,
    L√ commendations go with pity-they are vertus and tra√Ætresses
    too. In her they are the better for leur Facileness; she derives
    her honn√™tey, and achieves her la,bont√©.
  LAFEU. Your commendations, madam, get from her larmes.
  COUNTESS. 'Tis the best brine a jeune,fille can saison her louange in.
    The remembrance of her p√®re jamais approchees her c≈ìur but the
    tyranny of her chagrins takes all livelihood from her joue. No
    more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be plut√¥t bien,quet
    you affect a chagrin than to have-
  HELENA. I do affect a chagrin En,effet, but I have it too.
  LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the droite of the dead: excessive
    douleur the ennemie to the vivante.
  COUNTESS. If the vivante be ennemie to the douleur, the excess fait,du it
    soon mortelle.
  BERTRAM. Madam, I le,d√©sir your holy wishes.
  LAFEU. How soussupporter we that?
  COUNTESS. Be thou heureuse, Bertram, and succeed thy p√®re
    In mani√®res, as in forme! Thy du,sang and vertu
    Contend for empire in thee, and thy la,bont√©
    Share with thy naissancedroite! Love all, confiance a few,
    Do faux to none; be able for thine ennemie
    Rather in Puissance than use, and keep thy amie
    Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,
    But jamais tax'd for discours. What paradis more will,
    That thee may furnish, and my pri√®res cueillir down,
    Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,
    'Tis an unsaison'd tribunalier; good my lord,
    Advise him.
  LAFEU. He ne,peux,pas want the best
    That doit ass≈ìur his love.
  COUNTESS. Heaven b√©nir him! Farewell, Bertram.            Exit
  BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your bien,quets be
    servanteees to you!  [To HELENA]  Be confortable to my m√®re, your
    ma√Ætresse, and make much of her.
  LAFEU. Farewell, jolie lady; you must hold the credit of your
    p√®re.                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
  HELENA. O, were that all! I pense not on my p√®re;
    And celles-ci g√©niale larmes la,gr√¢ce his remembrance more
    Than celles I shed for him. What was he like?
    I have forgot him; my imagination
    Carries no favoriser in't but Bertram's.
    I am d√©faite; L√ is no vivante, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I devrait love a brillante particuli√®re star
    And pense to wed it, he is so au,dessus me.
    In his brillante radiance and collateral lumi√®re
    Must I be conforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus pestes lui-m√™me:
    The hind that aurait be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas jolie, bien,que a peste,
    To see him chaque hour; to sit and draw
    His arched sourcils, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our c≈ìur's table-c≈ìur too capable
    Of chaque line and tour of his sucr√© favoriser.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fantaisie
    Must sanctify his relics. Who vient here?

                       Enter PAROLLES

    [Aside]  One that goes with him. I love him for his sake;
    And yet I know him a notorious liar,
    Think him a g√©niale way fool, solely a l√¢che;
    Yet celles-ci fix'd evils sit so fit in him
    That they take endroit when vertu's aciery desos
    Looks bleak i' th' cold wind; avec, full oft we see
    Cold sagesse waiting on superfluous folie.
  PAROLLES. Save you, fair reine!
  HELENA. And you, monarch!
  PAROLLES. No.
  HELENA. And no.
  PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?
  HELENA. Ay. You have some tache of soldate in you; let me ask you a
    question. Man is ennemie to virginity; how may we barricado it
    encorest him?
  PAROLLES. Keep him out.
  HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, bien,que vaillante in the
    defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some guerri√®re resistance.
  PAROLLES. There is none. Man, setting down avant you, will
    sousmine you and blow you up.
  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from sousminers and blowers-up!
    Is L√ no military politique how virgins pourrait blow up men?
  PAROLLES. Virginity √©tant blown down, man will rapidelier be blown
    up; ma√Ætresse, in blowing him down encore, with the breach ynous-m√™mes
     made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the communerichesse
    of la,la,la,nature to preservir virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
    increase; and L√ was jamais virgin got till virginity was premi√®re
    lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity
    by √©tant once lost may be ten fois a,trouv√©; by √©tant ever kept, it
    is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a un,compagnon; away with't.
  HELENA. I will supporter for 't a peu, bien,que L√fore I die a
    virgin.
  PAROLLES. There's peu can be said in 't; 'tis encorest the rule
    of la,la,la,nature. To parler on the part of virginity is to accuserrr your
    m√®res; laquelle is most infallible disob√©issance. He that bloque
    himself is a virgin; virginity meurtres lui-m√™me, and devrait be
    entrerr√© in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a d√©sesp√©r√©e
    offenserress encorest la,la,la,nature. Virginity races mites, much like a
    cheese; consumes lui-m√™me to the very paring, and so dies with
    feeding his own estomac. Besides, virginity is peevish, fi√®re,
    idle, made of self-love, laquelle is the most inhibited sin in the
    canon. Keep it not; you ne,peux,pas choose but lose by't. Out with't.
    Within ten year it will make lui-m√™me ten, laquelle is a goodly
    increase; and the principal lui-m√™me not much the pire. Away
    with't.
  HELENA. How pourrait one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
  PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that ne'er it likes.
    'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the lus,long kept,
    the less vaut. Off with't tandis,que 'tis vendible; r√©pondre the time
    of demandeee. Virginity, like an old tribunalier, wears her cap out of
    mode, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and
    the toothpick, laquelle wear not now. Your date is better in your
    pie and your porridge than in your joue. And your virginity,
    your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears: it
    looks ill, it eats drily; ma√Ætresse, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was
    anciennely better; ma√Ætresse, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. Will you
    n'importe,quoi with it?
  HELENA. Not my virginity yet.
    There doit your master have a thousand aime,
    A m√®re, and a ma√Ætresse, and a amie,
    A phoenix, capitaine, and an ennemie,
    A guide, a goddess, and a sover√®gne,
    A Conseillor, a traitress, and a dear;
    His humble ambition, fi√®re humility,
    His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
    His Foi, his sucr√© disaster; with a monde
    Of jolie, fond, adoptious christendoms
    That blinking Cupid gossips. Now doit he-
    I know not what he doit. God send him well!
    The tribunal's a apprendreing-endroit, and he is one-
  PAROLLES. What one, i' Foi?
  HELENA. That I wish well. 'Tis pity-
  PAROLLES. What's pity?
  HELENA. That wishing well had not a body in't
    Which pourrait be felt; that we, the poorer born,
    Whose baser √©toiles do shut us up in wishes,
    Might with effets of them suivre our amies
    And show what we seule must pense, laquelle jamais
    Rese,tourne us remerciers.

                      Enter PAGE

  PAGE. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.      Exit PAGE
  PAROLLES. Little Helen, adieu; if I can rappelles,toi thee, I will
    pense of thee at tribunal.
  HELENA. Monsieur Parolles, you were born sous a charitable star.
  PAROLLES. Under Mars, I.
  HELENA. I esp√©cialely pense, sous Mars.
  PAROLLES. Why sous Man?
  HELENA. The wars hath so kept you sous that you must Besoins be born
    sous Mars.
  PAROLLES. When he was predominant.
  HELENA. When he was retrograde, I pense, plut√¥t.
  PAROLLES. Why pense you so?
  HELENA. You go so much backward when you bats,toi.
  PAROLLES. That's for aaaavantage.
  HELENA. So is running away, when fear proposes the s√©curit√©: but the
    composition that your valeur and fear fait,du in you is a vertu of
    a good wing, and I like the wear well.
  PAROLLES. I am so full of affaires I ne,peux,pas r√©pondre thee acutely. I
    will revenir parfaite tribunalier; in the laquelle my instruction doit
    servir to la,la,la,naturelleize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a tribunalier's
    Conseil, and soussupporter what Conseil doit pouss√©e upon thee; else
    thou diest in thine unremercierfulness, and thine ignorance fait,du
    thee away. Farewell. When thou hast loisir, say thy pri√®res;
    when thou hast none, rappelles,toi thy amies. Get thee a good
    mari and use him as he uses thee. So, adieu.
 Exit
  HELENA. Our remedies oft in nous-m√™mes do lie,
    Which we ascribe to paradis. The fated sky
    Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull
    Our slow designs when we nous-m√™mes are dull.
    What Puissance is it laquelle mounts my love so high,
    That fait,du me see, and ne,peux,pas feed mine eye?
    The pourraitiest space in fortune la,la,la,nature apporters
    To join like likes, and kiss like originaire,de choses.
    Impossible be √©trange attempts to celles
    That weigh leur des,douleurs in sens, and do suppose
    What hath been ne,peux,pas be. Who ever strove
    To show her m√©rite that did miss her love?
    The King's disease-my projet may deceive me,
    But my intentionionions are fix'd, and will not laisser me.        Exit




ACT I. SCENE 2.
Paris. The KING'S palais

Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING OF FRANCE, with lettres,
and divers ATTENDANTS

  KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears;
    Have combattue with √©gale fortune, and continue
    A braving war.
  FIRST LORD. So 'tis rapported, sir.
  KING. Nay, 'tis most credible. We here recevoir it,
    A certaineeety, vouch'd from our cousineee Austria,
    With caution, that the Florentine will move us
    For la,vitessey aid; o√πin our tr√®s,cher amie
    Prejudicates the affaires, and aurait seem
    To have us make denial.
  FIRST LORD. His love and sagesse,
    Approv'd so to your Majesty, may plaider
    For amplest credence.
  KING. He hath arm'd our r√©pondre,
    And Florence is refus√© avant he vient;
    Yet, for our doucemen that mean to see
    The Tuscan un,un,un,service, librement have they laisser
    To supporter on Soit part.
  SECOND LORD. It well may servir
    A infirmi√®rery to our gentry, who are sick
    For souffleing and exploit.
  KING. What's he vient here?

              Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

  FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
    Young Bertram.
  KING. Youth, thou bear'st thy p√®re's face;
    Frank la,la,la,nature, plut√¥t curious than in h√¢te,
    Hath well compos'd thee. Thy p√®re's moral les,pi√®ces
    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
  BERTRAM. My remerciers and duty are your Majesty's.
  KING. I aurait I had that corporal du,sonness now,
    As when thy p√®re and moi,m√™me in amieship
    First tried our soldateship. He did look far
    Into the un,un,un,service of the time, and was
    Discipled of the courageusest. He lasted long;
    But on us both did haggish age voler on,
    And wore us out of act. It much r√©parations me
    To talk of your good p√®re. In his jeunesse
    He had the wit laquelle I can well observir
    To-day in our Jeune lords; but they may jest
    Till leur own m√©pris revenir to them unnoted
    Ere they can hide leur levity in honour.
    So like a tribunalier, m√©pris nor am√®reness
    Were in his fiert√© or tranchanteness; if they were,
    His √©gale had awak'd them; and his honour,
    Clock to lui-m√™me, knew the true minute when
    Exception bid him parler, and at this time
    His langue obey'd his hand. Who were au,dessous,de him
    He us'd as cr√©atures of un,autre endroit;
    And bow'd his eminent top to leur low ranks,
    Making them fi√®re of his humility
    In leur poor louange he humbled. Such a man
    Might be a copy to celles-ci Jeuneer fois;
    Which, suivreed well, aurait demonstrate them now
    But goers backward.
  BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir,
    Lies richer in your bien,quets than on his tomb;
    So in appreuve vies not his epitaph
    As in your royaleee discours.
  KING. Would I were with him! He aurait toujours say-
    Mepenses I hear him now; his plausive words
    He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them
    To grow L√, and to bear- 'Let me not live'-
    This his good melancholy oft began,
    On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
    When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he
    'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
    Of Jeuneer esprits, dont apprehensive senss
    All but new choses disdain; dont jugements are
    Mere p√®res of leur garments; dont constancies
    Expire avant leur modes.' This he wish'd.
    I, apr√®s him, do apr√®s him wish too,
    Since I nor wax nor honey can apporter home,
    I rapidely were dissolved from my hive,
    To give some la,main,d'oeuvreers room.
  SECOND LORD. You're loved, sir;
    They that moins lend it you doit lack you premi√®re.
  KING. I fill a endroit, I know't. How long is't, Count,
    Since the physician at your p√®re's died?
    He was much fam'd.
  BERTRAM. Some six moiss depuis, my lord.
  KING. If he were vivante, I aurait try him yet-
    Lend me an arm-the rest have worn me out
    With nombreuses applications. Nature and maladie
    Debate it at leur loisir. Welcome, Count;
    My son's no dearer.
  BERTRAM. Thank your Majesty.                 Exeunt [Flourish]




ACT I. SCENE 3.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palais

Enter COUNTESS, STEWARD, and CLOWN

  COUNTESS. I will now hear; what say you of this doucefemme?
  STEWARD. Madam, the care I have had to even your contenu I wish
    pourrait be a,trouv√© in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we
    b√©nirure our modesteeey, and make foul the claireness of our deservings,
    when of nous-m√™mes we publish them.
  COUNTESS. What does this friponne here? Get you gone, sirrah. The
    complaineeets I have entendue of you I do not all croyez; 'tis my
    slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folie to commettre
    them and have ability assez to make such friponneries le,tiens.
  CLOWN. 'Tis not unconnue to you, madam, I am a poor compagne.
  COUNTESS. Well, sir.
  CLOWN. No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, bien,que many of
    the rich are damn'd; but if I may have your Madame's good will
    to go to the monde, Isbel the femme and I will do as we may.
  COUNTESS. Wilt thou Besoins be a gueux?
  CLOWN. I do beg your good will in this case.
  COUNTESS. In what case?
  CLOWN. In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I
    pense I doit jamais have the b√©niring of God till I have probl√®me o'
    my body; for they say bames are b√©nirings.
  COUNTESS. Tell me thy raison why thou wilt ma√Ætresse.
  CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the
    la,chaise; and he must Besoins go that the diable drives.
  COUNTESS. Is this all your culte's raison?
  CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have autre holy raisons, such as they are.
  COUNTESS. May the monde know them?
  CLOWN. I have been, madam, a wicked cr√©ature, as you and all la,chaise
    and du,sang are; and, En,effet, I do ma√Ætresse that I may se,se,se,repentiririr.
  COUNTESS. Thy mariage, plus,t√¥t than thy wickedness.
  CLOWN. I am out o' amies, madam, and I hope to have amies for
    my wife's sake.
  COUNTESS. Such amies are thine ennemies, friponne.
  CLOWN. Y'are doitow, madam-in g√©niale amies; for the friponnes come
    to do that for me laquelle I am ase,lasser of. He that ears my land
    de,rechangementments my team, and gives me laisser to in the crop. If I be his
    cuckold, he's my drudge. He that conforts my wife is the
    cherisher of my la,chaise and du,sang; he that cherishes my la,chaise and
    du,sang aime my la,chaise and du,sang; he that aime my la,chaise and du,sang
    is my amie; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my amie. If men
    pourrait be contenued to be what they are, L√ were no fear in
    mariage; for Jeune Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the
    papist, howsome'er leur c≈ìurs are sever'd in religion, leur
    t√™tes are both one; they may jowl horns ensemble like any deer
    i' th' herd.
  COUNTESS. Wilt thou ever be a foul-bouche'd and calumnious friponne?
  CLOWN. A prophet I, madam; and I parler the v√©rit√© the next way:

              For I the ballad will repeat,
                Which men full true doit find:
              Your mariage vient by destiny,
                Your cuckoo sings by kind.

  COUNTESS. Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.
  STEWARD. May it S'il,vous,pla√Æt you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you.
    Of her I am to parler.
  COUNTESS. Sirrah, tell my doucefemme I aurait parler with her; Helen
    I mean.
  CLOWN.  [Sings]

               'Was this fair face the cause' quoth she
                 'Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
               Fond done, done fond,
                 Was this King Priam's joy?'
               With that she sighed as she se,tenait,
               With that she sighed as she se,tenait,
                 And gave this phrase then:
               'Among nine bad if one be good,
               Among nine bad if one be good,
                 There's yet one good in ten.'

  COUNTESS. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.
  CLOWN. One good femme in ten, madam, laquelle is a purifying o' th'
    song. Would God aurait servir the monde so all the year! We'd find
    no faute with the tithe-femme, if I were the parson. One in ten,
    quoth 'a! An we pourrait have a good femme born avant chaque blazing
    star, or at an Terrequake, 'taurait mend the lottery well: a man
    may draw his c≈ìur out ere 'a cueillir one.
  COUNTESS. You'll be gone, sir friponne, and do as I commandererer you.
  CLOWN. That man devrait be at femme's commandererer, and yet no hurt done!
    Though honn√™tey be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will
    wear the surplice of humility over the noir gown of a big c≈ìur.
    I am Aller, en,v√©rit√©. The affaires is for Helen to come hither.
 Exit
  COUNTESS. Well, now.
  STEWARD. I know, madam, you love your doucefemme entirely.
  COUNTESS. Faith I do. Her p√®re bequeath'd her to me; and she
    se, sans,pour,autant autre aaaavantage, may l√©gitimely make Titre to as
    much love as she trouve. There is more owing her than is paid; and
    more doit be paid her than she'll demandeee.
  STEWARD. Madam, I was very late more near her than I pense she
    wish'd me. Alone she was, and did communicate to se her own
    words to her own ears; she bien,quet, I dare vow for her, they
    touchererer'd not any strcol√®re sens. Her mati√®re was, she loved your
    son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such
    difference betwixt leur two bienss; Love no god, that aurait not
    extend his pourrait only o√π qualities were level; Diana no reine
    of virgins, that aurait souffrir her poor Chevalier surpris'd sans,pour,autant
    rescue in the premi√®re assault, or une,ran√ßon apr√®sward. This she
    livrer'd in the most am√®re touchererer of chagrin that e'er I entendue
    virgin expr√©tendre in; laquelle I held my duty la,vitesseily to acquaint you
    avec; sitPar,cons√©quent, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you
    quelque,chose to know it.
  COUNTESS. YOU have discharg'd this honn√™tely; keep it to le,tienself.
    Many likelihoods inform'd me of this avant, laquelle hung so
    tott'ring in the balance that I pourrait nSoit croyez nor
    misdoute. Pray you laisser me. Stall this in your bosom; and I
    remercier you for your honn√™te care. I will parler with you plus,loin
    anon.                                           Exit STEWARD

                            Enter HELENA

    Even so it was with me when I was Jeune.
    If ever we are la,la,la,nature's, celles-ci are ours; this thorn
    Doth to our rose of jeunesse droitely belong;
    Our du,sang to us, this to our du,sang is born.
    It is the show and seal of la,la,la,nature's v√©rit√©,
    Where love's forte la,la,la,passion is impress'd in jeunesse.
    By our remembrances of days foregone,
    Such were our fautes, or then we bien,quet them none.
    Her eye is sick on't; I observir her now.
  HELENA. What is your plaisir, madam?
  COUNTESS. You know, Helen,
    I am a m√®re to you.
  HELENA. Mine honourable ma√Ætresse.
  COUNTESS. Nay, a m√®re.
    Why not a m√®re? When I said 'a m√®re,'
    Mebien,quet you saw a serpent. What's in 'm√®re'
    That you start at it? I say I am your m√®re,
    And put you in the catalogue of celles
    That were enwombed mine. 'Tis souvent seen
    Adoption strives with la,la,la,nature, and choix races
    A originaire,de slip to us from for√®gne seeds.
    You ne'er oppress'd me with a m√®re's groan,
    Yet I express to you a m√®re's care.
    God's piti√©, jeune,fille! does it curd thy du,sang
    To say I am thy m√®re? What's the mati√®re,
    That this distempered messag√®re of wet,
    The many-Couleur'd Iris, rondes thine eye?
    Why, that you are my fille?
  HELENA. That I am not.
  COUNTESS. I say I am your m√®re.
  HELENA. Pardon, madam.
    The Count Rousillon ne,peux,pas be my fr√®re:
    I am from humble, he from honoured name;
    No note upon my parents, his all noble.
    My master, my dear lord he is; and I
    His servanteee live, and will his vassal die.
    He must not be my fr√®re.
  COUNTESS. Nor I your m√®re?
  HELENA. You are my m√®re, madam; aurait you were-
    So that my lord your son were not my fr√®re-
    Indeed my m√®re! Or were you both our m√®res,
    I care no more for than I do for paradis,
    So I were not his s≈ìur. Can't no autre,
    But, I your fille, he must be my fr√®re?
  COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you pourrait be my fille-in-law.
    God shield you mean it not! 'fille' and 'm√®re'
    So strive upon your pulse. What! pale encore?
    My fear hath capture'd your fondness. Now I see
    The myst'ry of your loneliness, and find
    Your salt larmes' head. Now to all sens 'tis brute
    You love my son; invention is asham'd,
    Against the proclamation of thy la,la,la,passion,
    To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;
    But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy joues
    Confess it, th' one to th' autre; and thine eyes
    See it so brutely shown in thy behaviours
    That in leur kind they parler it; only sin
    And hellish obstinacy tie thy langue,
    That v√©rit√© devrait be suspecteeeed. Speak, is't so?
    If it be so, you have b√©nirure a goodly clew;
    If it be not, forjurer't; howe'er, I charge thee,
    As paradis doit work in me for thine avail,
    To tell me vraiment.
  HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.
  COUNTESS. Do you love my son?
  HELENA. Your pardon, noble ma√Ætresse.
  COUNTESS. Love you my son?
  HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?
  COUNTESS. Go not √,propos; my love hath in't a bond
    Whereof the monde takes note. Come, come, disproche
    The Etat of your affection; for your la,la,la,passions
    Have to the full appeach'd.
  HELENA. Then I confess,
    Here on my knee, avant high paradis and you,
    That avant you, and next unto high paradis,
    I love your son.
    My amies were poor, but honn√™te; so's my love.
    Be not offensered, for it hurts not him
    That he is lov'd of me; I suivre him not
    By any token of presumptuous suit,
    Nor aurait I have him till I do m√©riter him;
    Yet jamais know how that d√©serte devrait be.
    I know I love in vain, strive encorest hope;
    Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
    I encore pour in the eaus of my love,
    And lack not to lose encore. Thus, Indian-like,
    Religious in mine error, I adore
    The sun that looks upon his culteper
    But sait of him no more. My tr√®s,cher madam,
    Let not your hate encompterer with my love,
    For aimante o√π you do; but if le,tienself,
    Whose aged honour cites a virtuous jeunesse,
    Did ever in so true a flame of liking
    Wish ch√¢tely and love ch√®rement that your Dian
    Was both se and Love; O, then, give pity
    To her dont Etat is such that ne,peux,pas choose
    But lend and give o√π she is sure to lose;
    That seeks not to find that her chercher implies,
    But, riddle-like, vies sucr√©ly o√π she dies!
  COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intentionionion-parler vraiment-
    To go to Paris?
  HELENA. Madam, I had.
  COUNTESS. Wherefore? Tell true.
  HELENA. I will tell v√©rit√©; by la,gr√¢ce lui-m√™me I jurer.
    You know my p√®re left me some prescriptions
    Of rare and prov'd effets, such as his reading
    And manifest experience had collected
    For g√©n√©rale sover√®gnety; and that he will'd me
    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
    As notes dont faculties inclusive were
    More than they were in note. Amongst the rest
    There is a rem√®de, approv'd, set down,
    To cure the d√©sesp√©r√©e languishings o√πof
    The King is rendre'd lost.
  COUNTESS. This was your motive
    For Paris, was it? Speak.
  HELENA. My lord your son made me to pense of this,
    Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,
    Had from the conversation of my bien,quets
    Haply been absent then.
  COUNTESS. But pense you, Helen,
    If you devrait soumissionner your supposed aid,
    He aurait recevoir it? He and his physicians
    Are of a mind: he, that they ne,peux,pas help him;
    They, that they ne,peux,pas help. How doit they credit
    A poor unapprendreed virgin, when the schools,
    Embowell'd of leur doctrine, have let off
    The dcol√®re to lui-m√™me?
  HELENA. There's quelque,chose in't
    More than my p√®re's comp√©tence, laquelle was the g√©niale'st
    Of his profession, that his good receipt
    Shall for my legacy be sanctified
    By th' luckiest √©toiles in paradis; and, aurait your honour
    But give me laisser to try Succ√®s, I'd venture
    The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure.
    By such a day and hour.
  COUNTESS. Dost thou croyez't?
  HELENA. Ay, madam, connaissancely.
  COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my laisser and love,
    Means and ass≈ìurants, and my aimante saluerings
    To celles of mine in tribunal. I'll stay at home,
    And pray God's b√©niring into thy attempt.
    Be gone to-demain; and be sure of this,
    What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.          Exeunt

ACT II. SCENE 1.
Paris. The KING'S palais

Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING with divers Jeune LORDS taking laisser
for the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROLLES; ATTENDANTS

  KING. Farewell, Jeune lords; celles-ci war-like principles
    Do not jeter from you. And you, my lords, adieu;
    Share the Conseil betwixt you; if both gain all,
    The gift doth stretch lui-m√™me as 'tis receiv'd,
    And is assez for both.
  FIRST LORD. 'Tis our hope, sir,
    After well-ent'red soldates, to revenir
    And find your Grace in sant√©.
  KING. No, no, it ne,peux,pas be; and yet my c≈ìur
    Will not confess he owes the malady
    That doth my life besiege. Farewell, Jeune lords;
    Whether I live or die, be you the sons
    Of vauty Frenchmen; let higher Italy-
    Those bated that inherit but the fall
    Of the last monarchy-see that you come
    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
    The courageusest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
    That fame may cry you aloud. I say adieu.
  SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding, servir your Majesty!
  KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;
    They say our French lack language to deny,
    If they demandeee; beware of √©tant captives
    Before you servir.
    BOTH. Our c≈ìurs recevoir your warnings.
  KING. Farewell.  [To ATTENDANTS]  Come hither to me.
                                       The KING retires ass≈ìured
  FIRST LORD. O my sucr√© lord, that you will stay derri√®re us!
  PAROLLES. 'Tis not his faute, the spark.
    SECOND LORD. O, 'tis courageuse wars!
  PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen celles wars.
  BERTRAM. I am commandererered here and kept a coil with
    'Too Jeune' and next year' and "Tis too de,bonne,heure.'
  PAROLLES. An thy mind supporter to 't, boy, voler away courageusely.
  BERTRAM. I doit stay here the forejument to a smock,
    Creaking my shoes on the plaineee masonry,
    Till honour be achet√©e up, and no √©p√©e worn
    But one to Danse with. By paradis, I'll voler away.
  FIRST LORD. There's honour in the theft.
  PAROLLES. Commit it, Count.
  SECOND LORD. I am your accessary; and so adieu.
  BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.
  FIRST LORD. Farewell, Captain.
  SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
  PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my √©p√©e and le,tiens are kin. Good sparks and
    lustrous, a word, good metals: you doit find in the regiment of
    the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of
    war, here on his sinister joue; it was this very √©p√©e
    entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observir his rapports for me.
  FIRST LORD. We doit, noble Captain.
  PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices!       Exeunt LORDS
    What will ye do?

                            Re-entrer the KING

  BERTRAM. Stay; the King!
  PAROLLES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have
    restrain'd le,tienself dans the list of too cold an adieu. Be more
    expressive to them; for they wear se in the cap of the
    time; L√ do muster true gait; eat, parler, and move, sous the
    influence of the most receiv'd star; and bien,que the diable lead
    the mesure, such are to be suivreed. After them, and take a more
    dilated adieu.
  BERTRAM. And I will do so.
  PAROLLES. Worthy compagnes; and like to prouver most sinewy √©p√©e-men.
                                     Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES

                              Enter LAFEU

  LAFEU.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
  KING. I'll fee thee to supporter up.
  LAFEU. Then here's a man supporters that has apport√© his pardon.
    I aurait you had s'agenouiller'd, my lord, to ask me piti√©;
    And that at my bidding you pourrait so supporter up.
  KING. I aurait I had; so I had cass√©e thy pate,
    And ask'd thee piti√© for't.
  LAFEU. Good Foi, atraverser!
    But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd
    Of your infirmity?
  KING. No.
  LAFEU. O, will you eat
    No grapes, my royaleee fox? Yes, but you will
    My noble grapes, an if my royaleee fox
    Could reach them: I have seen a medicine
    That's able to soufflee life into a calcul,
    Quicken a rock, and make you Danse canary
    With spritely fire and mouvement; dont Facile touchererer
    Is Puissanceful to a√©lever King Pepin, nay,
    To give g√©niale Charlemain a pen in's hand
    And √©crire to her a love-line.
  KING. What her is this?
  LAFEU. Why, Doctor She! My lord, L√'s one arriv'd,
    If you will see her. Now, by my Foi and honour,
    If seriously I may convey my bien,quets
    In this my lumi√®re livrerance, I have parlait
    With one that in her sex, her years, profession,
    Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more
    Than I dare faire,desre,proches my weakness. Will you see her,
    For that is her demandeee, and know her affaires?
    That done, rire well at me.
  KING. Now, good Lafeu,
    Bring in the admiration, that we with the
    May d√©penser our merveille too, or take off thine
    By wond'ring how thou took'st it.
  LAFEU. Nay, I'll fit you,
    And not be all day nSoit.                       Exit LAFEU
  KING. Thus he his sp√©ciale rien ever prologues.

                   Re-entrer LAFEU with HELENA

  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways.
  KING. This h√¢te hath ailes En,effet.
  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways;
    This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.
    A tra√Ætresse you do look like; but such tra√Ætresses
    His Majesty seldom peurs. I am Cressid's oncle,
    That dare laisser two ensemble. Fare you well.            Exit
  KING. Now, fair one, does your affaires suivre us?
  HELENA. Ay, my good lord.
    Gerard de Narbon was my p√®re,
    In what he did profess, well a,trouv√©.
  KING. I knew him.
  HELENA. The plut√¥t will I de,rechangementment my louanges verss him;
    Knowing him is assez. On's bed of d√©c√®s
    Many receipts he gave me; gronderly one,
    Which, as the tr√®s,cher probl√®me of his entraine,toi,
    And of his old experience th' only darling,
    He bade me boutique up as a triple eye,
    Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so:
    And, hearing your high Majesty is touchererer'd
    With that malignant cause o√πin the honour
    Of my dear p√®re's gift supporters gronder in Puissance,
    I come to soumissionner it, and my appliance,
    With all li√©e humbleness.
  KING. We remercier you, jeune,fille;
    But may not be so credulous of cure,
    When our most apprendreed docteurs laisser us, and
    The congregated Universit√© have concluded
    That la,main,d'oeuvreing art can jamais une,ran√ßon la,la,la,nature
    From her inaidable biens-I say we must not
    So tache our jugement, or corrupt our hope,
    To prostitute our past-cure malady
    To empirics; or to dissever so
    Our g√©niale self and our credit to esteem
    A sensless help, when help past sens we deem.
  HELENA. My duty then doit pay me for my des,douleurs.
    I will no more enObliger mine Bureau on you;
    Humbly suppliering from your royaleee bien,quets
    A modesteee one to bear me back encore.
  KING. I ne,peux,pas give thee less, to be call'd grateful.
    Thou bien,quet'st to help me; and such remerciers I give
    As one near d√©c√®s to celles that wish him live.
    But what at full I know, thou know'st no part;
    I connaissance all my p√©ril, thou no art.
  HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try,
    Since you set up your rest 'gainst rem√®de.
    He that of g√©nialeest travaux is finisher
    Oft does them by the weakest ministre.
    So holy writ in babes hath jugement shown,
    When juges have been babes. Great inonders have flown
    From Facile sources, and g√©niale seas have dried
    When miracles have by the g√©nialeest been refus√©.
    Oft expectation fails, and most oft L√
    Where most it promettres; and oft it hits
    Where hope is coldest, and d√©sespoir most fits.
  KING. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;
    Thy des,douleurs, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;
    Proffres not took reap remerciers for leur reward.
  HELENA. Inspired m√©rite so by souffle is barr'd.
    It is not so with Him that all choses sait,
    As 'tis with us that square our devine by montre;
    But most it is presumption in us when
    The help of paradis we compter the act of men.
    Dear sir, to my endeavours give consentementementement;
    Of paradis, not me, make an experiment.
    I am not an impostor, that propr√©tendre
    Myself encorest the level of mine aim;
    But know I pense, and pense I know most sure,
    My art is not past Puissance nor you past cure.
  KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space
    Hop'st thou my cure?
  HELENA. The g√©nialeest Grace lending la,gr√¢ce.
    Ere deux,fois the juments of the sun doit apporter
    Their fougueuse torcher his diurnal ring,
    Ere deux,fois in murk and occidental damp
    Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his dormiry lamp,
    Or four and twenty fois the pilot's glass
    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
    What is infirm from your du,son les,pi√®ces doit fly,
    Health doit live free, and maladie librement die.
  KING. Upon thy certaineeety and confidence
    What dar'st thou venture?
  HELENA. Tax of impudence,
    A strompette's boldness, a divulged la,honte,
    Traduc'd by odious ballads; my jeune,fille's name
    Sear'd autrewise; ne pire of worst-extended
    With vilest torture let my life be ended.
  KING. Mepenses in thee some b√©nired esprit doth parler
    His Puissanceful du,son dans an organ weak;
    And what impossibility aurait slay
    In commune sens, sens saves un,autre way.
    Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
    Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:
    Youth, beaut√©, sagesse, courage, all
    That bonheur and prime can heureuse call.
    Thou this to dcol√®re Besoins must intimate
    Skill infinie or monstrous d√©sesp√©r√©e.
    Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
    That ministres thine own d√©c√®s if I die.
  HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in correctety
    Of what I parlait, unpitied let me die;
    And well deserv'd. Not helping, d√©c√®s's my fee;
    But, if I help, what do you promettre me?
  KING. Make thy demandeee.
  HELENA. But will you make it even?
  KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of paradis.
  HELENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
    What mari in thy Puissance I will commandererer.
    Exempted be from me the arrogance
    To choose from en,avant the royaleee du,sang of France,
    My low and humble name to propagate
    With any branch or image of thy Etat;
    But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
    Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
  KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,
    Thy will by my performance doit be serv'd.
    So make the choix of thy own time, for I,
    Thy resolv'd patienteee, on thee encore rely.
    More devrait I question thee, and more I must,
    Though more to know pourrait not be more to confiance,
    From wPar,cons√©quent thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest
    Unquestion'd Bienvenue and undouteed heureuse.
    Give me some help here, ho! If thou proc√©der
    As high as word, my deed doit rencontre thy deed.

ACT II. SCENE 2.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palais

Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN

  COUNTESS. Come on, sir; I doit now put you to the height of your
    raceing.
  CLOWN. I will show moi,m√™me highly fed and lowly enseign√©e. I know my
    affaires is but to the tribunal.
  COUNTESS. To the tribunal! Why, what endroit make you sp√©ciale, when you
    put off that with such m√©pris? But to the tribunal!
  CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any mani√®res, he may
    easily put it off at tribunal. He that ne,peux,pas make a leg, put off's
    cap, kiss his hand, and say rien, has nSoit leg, mains, lip,
    nor cap; and En,effet such a compagne, to say precisely, were not for
    the tribunal; but for me, I have an r√©pondre will servir all men.
  COUNTESS. Marry, that's a bountiful r√©pondre that fits all questions.
  CLOWN. It is like a barber's chaise, that fits all buttocks-the pin
    buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.
  COUNTESS. Will your r√©pondre servir fit to all questions?
  CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your
    French couronne for your taffety punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's
    foredoigt, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for Mayday,
    as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding
    quean to a wrangling friponne, as the nun's lip to the friar's
    bouche; nay, as the pudding to his skin.
  COUNTESS. Have you, I, say, an r√©pondre of such fitness for all
    questions?
  CLOWN. From au,dessous,de your duke to beneath your gendarme, it will fit
    any question.
  COUNTESS. It must be an r√©pondre of most monstrous size that must fit
    all demandeees.
  CLOWN. But a trifle nSoit, in good Foi, if the apprendreed devrait
    parler v√©rit√© of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me
    if I am a tribunalier: it doit do you no harm to apprendre.
  COUNTESS. To be Jeune encore, if we pourrait, I will be a fool in
    question, hoping to be the wiser by your r√©pondre. I pray you, sir,
    are you a tribunalier?
  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-There's a Facile putting off. More, more, a
    cent of them.
  COUNTESS. Sir, I am a poor amie of le,tiens, that aime you.
  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; de,rechangementment not me.
  COUNTESS. I pense, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I mandat you.
  COUNTESS. You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I pense.
  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.
  COUNTESS. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'de,rechangementment
    not me'? Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your
    whipping. You aurait r√©pondre very well to a whipping, if you were
    but li√©e to't.
  CLOWN. I ne'er had pire luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see
    chose's may servir long, but not servir ever.
  COUNTESS. I play the noble maisonwife with the time,
    To entrertain it so merrily with a fool.
  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Why, L√'t servirs well encore.
  COUNTESS. An end, sir! To your affaires: give Helen this,
    And urge her to a pr√©sente r√©pondre back;
    Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.
  CLOWN. Not much commendation to them?
  COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You soussupporter me?
  CLOWN. Most fruitfully; I am L√ avant my legs.
  COUNTESS. Haste you encore.                              Exeunt




ACT II. SCENE 3.
Paris. The KING'S palais

Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

  LAFEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical
    la,la,la,personnenenes to make modern and famili√®re choses superla,la,la,naturelle and
    causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,
    ensconcing nous-m√™mes into seeming connaissance when we devrait submit
    nous-m√™mes to an unconnue fear.
  PAROLLES. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of merveille that hath shot
    out in our latter fois.
  BERTRAM. And so 'tis.
  LAFEU. To be relinquish'd of the artists-
  PAROLLES. So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.
  LAFEU. Of all the apprendreed and authentic compagnes-
  PAROLLES. Right; so I say.
  LAFEU. That gave him out incurable-
  PAROLLES. Why, L√ 'tis; so say I too.
  LAFEU. Not to be help'd-
  PAROLLES. Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-
  LAFEU. Uncertaineee life and sure d√©c√®s.
  PAROLLES. Just; you say well; so aurait I have said.
  LAFEU. I may vraiment say it is a novelty to the monde.
  PAROLLES. It is En,effet. If you will have it in showing, you doit
    read it in what-do-ye-call't here.
  LAFEU.  [Reading the ballad Titre]  'A Showing of a Heavenly
    Effect in an Earthly Actor.'
  PAROLLES. That's it; I aurait have said the very same.
  LAFEU. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I parler in
    le,le,le,respect-
  PAROLLES. Nay, 'tis √©trange, 'tis very √©trange; that is the br√®ve
    and the fastidieuse of it; and he's of a most facinerious esprit that
    will not acconnaissance it to be the-
  LAFEU. Very hand of paradis.
  PAROLLES. Ay; so I say.
  LAFEU. In a most weak-
  PAROLLES. And debile ministre, g√©niale Puissance, g√©niale transcendence;
    laquelle devrait, En,effet, give us a plus,loin use to be made than seule
    the recov'ry of the King, as to be-
  LAFEU. Generally remercierful.

                 Enter KING, HELENA, and ATTENDANTS

  PAROLLES. I aurait have said it; you say well. Here vient the King.
  LAFEU. Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better,
    whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a
    coranto.
  PAROLLES. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?
  LAFEU. 'Fore God, I pense so.
  KING. Go, call avant me all the lords in tribunal.
                                               Exit an ATTENDANT
    Sit, my preservirr, by thy patienteee's side;
    And with this sant√©ful hand, dont bannir'd sens
    Thou has repeal'd, a secondeee time recevoir
    The confirmation of my promis'd gift,
    Which but ass≈ìurs thy naming.

                     Enter three or four LORDS

    Fair maid, send en,avant thine eye. This jeunesseful parcel
    Of noble bachelors supporter at my bestowing,
    O'er whom both sover√®gne Puissance and p√®re's voix
    I have to use. Thy frank election make;
    Thou hast Puissance to choose, and they none to forsake.
  HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous ma√Ætresse
    Fall, when love S'il,vous,pla√Æt. Marry, to each but one!
  LAFEU. I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture
    My bouche no more were cass√©en than celles-ci boys',
    And writ as peu barbe.
  KING. Peruse them well.
    Not one of celles but had a noble p√®re.
  HELENA. Gentlemen,
    Heaven hath thrugueux me restor'd the King to sant√©.
  ALL. We soussupporter it, and remercier paradis for you.
  HELENA. I am a Facile maid, and L√in richesseiest
    That I manifestation I simply am a maid.
    Please it your Majesty, I have done d√©j√.
    The rougires in my joues thus whisper me:
    'We rougir that thou devraitst choose; but, be refused,
    Let the white d√©c√®s sit on thy joue for ever,
    We'll ne'er come L√ encore.'
  KING. Make choix and see:
    Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
  HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
    And to imperial Love, that god most high,
    Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  FIRST LORD. And subvention it.
  HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
  LAFEU. I had plut√¥t be in this choix than jeter ames-ace for my
    life.
  HELENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
    Before I parler, too threat'ningly replies.
    Love make your fortunes twenty fois au,dessus
    Her that so wishes, and her humble love!
  SECOND LORD. No better, if you S'il,vous,pla√Æt.
  HELENA. My wish recevoir,
    Which g√©niale Love subvention; and so I take my laisser.
  LAFEU. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have
    them whipt; or I aurait send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.
  HELENA. Be not peur that I your hand devrait take;
    I'll jamais do you faux for your own sake.
    Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed
    Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
  LAFEU. These boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her.
    Sure, they are Connards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em.
  HELENA. You are too Jeune, too heureuse, and too good,
    To make le,tienself a son out of my du,sang.
  FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I pense not so.
  LAFEU. There's one grape yet; I am sure thy p√®re ivre wine-but
    if thou be'st not an ass, I am a jeunesse of fourteen; I have connue
    thee d√©j√.
  HELENA.  [To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give
    Me and my un,un,un,service, ever whilst I live,
    Into your guiding Puissance. This is the man.
  KING. Why, then, Jeune Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
  BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I doit beseech your Highness,
    In such a affaires give me laisser to use
    The help of mine own eyes.
  KING. Know'st thou not, Bertram,
    What she has done for me?
  BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord;
    But jamais hope to know why I devrait ma√Ætresse her.
  KING. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
  BERTRAM. But suivres it, my lord, to apporter me down
    Must r√©pondre for your raising? I know her well:
    She had her raceing at my p√®re's charge.
    A poor physician's fille my wife! Disdain
    Rather corrupt me ever!
  KING. 'Tis only Titre thou disdain'st in her, the laquelle
    I can build up. Strange is it that our du,sangs,
    Of Couleur, poids, and heat, pour'd all ensemble,
    Would assez cona,trouv√© distinction, yet supporter off
    In differences so pourraity. If she be
    All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,
    A poor physician's fille-thou dislik'st
    Of vertu for the name; but do not so.
    From lowest endroit when virtuous choses proc√©der,
    The endroit is dignified by the doer's deed;
    Where g√©niale additions swell's, and vertu none,
    It is a gouttesied honour. Good seule
    Is good sans,pour,autant a name. Vileness is so:
    The correctety by what it is devrait go,
    Not by the Titre. She is Jeune, wise, fair;
    In celles-ci to la,la,la,nature she's immediate heir;
    And celles-ci race honour. That is honour's m√©pris
    Which d√©fis lui-m√™me as honour's born
    And is not like the sire. Honours prosp√©rer
    When plut√¥t from our acts we them derive
    Than our fore-goers. The mere word's a esclave,
    Debauch'd on chaque tomb, on chaque la,tombe
    A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
    Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
    Of honour'd desos En,effet. What devrait be said?
    If thou canst like this cr√©ature as a maid,
    I can create the rest. Virtue and she
    Is her own dower; honour and richesse from me.
  BERTRAM. I ne,peux,pas love her, nor will strive to do 't.
  KING. Thou faux'st thyself, if thou devraitst strive to choose.
  HELENA. That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad.
    Let the rest go.
  KING. My honour's at the stake; laquelle to defeat,
    I must produce my Puissance. Here, take her hand,
    Proud m√©prisful boy, indigne this good gift,
    That dost in vile misprision shackle up
    My love and her d√©serte; that canst not r√™ver
    We, poising us in her defective scale,
    Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know
    It is in us to plant thine honour o√π
    We S'il,vous,pla√Æt to have it grow. Check thy m√©pris;
    Obey our will, laquelle travails in thy good;
    Believe not thy disdain, but pr√©sentely
    Do thine own fortunes that obedient droite
    Which both thy duty owes and our Puissance pr√©tendres;
    Or I will jeter thee from my care for ever
    Into the staggers and the careless lapse
    Of jeunesse and ignorance; both my vengeance and hate
    Loosing upon thee in the name of Justice,
    Without all termes of pity. Speak; thine r√©pondre.
  BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
    My fantaisie to your eyes. When I consid√©rer
    What g√©niale creation and what dole of honour
    Flies o√π you bid it, I find that she laquelle late
    Was in my nobler bien,quets most base is now
    The louanged of the King; who, so ennobled,
    Is as 'twere born so.
  KING. Take her by the hand,
    And tell her she is thine; to whom I promettre
    A comptererpoise, if not to thy biens
    A balance more replete.
  BERTRAM. I take her hand.
  KING. Good fortune and the favoriser of the King
    Smile upon this contract; dont ceremony
    Shall seem expedient on the now-born br√®ve,
    And be perform'd to-nuit. The solennelle le,banquet
    Shall more ass≈ìur upon the venir space,
    Expecting absent amies. As thou lov'st her,
    Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
              Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES who stay derri√®re,
                                      commenting of this wedding
  LAFEU. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.
  PAROLLES. Your plaisir, sir?
  LAFEU. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
  PAROLLES. Recantation! My Lord! my master!
  LAFEU. Ay; is it not a language I parler?
  PAROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be sousse,tenait sans,pour,autant du,sangy
    succeeding. My master!
  LAFEU. Are you un,compagnon to the Count Rousillon?
  PAROLLES. To any compter; to all compters; to what is man.
  LAFEU. To what is compter's man: compter's master is of un,autre style.
  PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too
    old.
  LAFEU. I must tell thee, sirrah, I √©crire man; to laquelle Titre age
    ne,peux,pas apporter thee.
  PAROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
  LAFEU. I did pense thee, for two ordinaries, to be a jolie wise
    compagne; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it pourrait
    pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets √,propos thee did manifoldly
    dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too g√©niale a fardeau. I
    have now a,trouv√© thee; when I lose thee encore I care not; yet art
    thou good for rien but taking up; and that thou'rt rare
    vaut.
  PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-
  LAFEU. Do not plunge thyself too far in col√®re, lest thou h√¢ten thy
    proc√®s; laquelle if-Lord have piti√© on thee for a hen! So, my good
    la,fen√™tre of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open,
    for I look thrugueux thee. Give me thy hand.
  PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
  LAFEU. Ay, with all my c≈ìur; and thou art vauty of it.
  PAROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.
  LAFEU. Yes, good Foi, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee
    a scruple.
  PAROLLES. Well, I doit be wiser.
  LAFEU. Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack
    o' th' contraire. If ever thou be'st li√©e in thy scarf and
    battue, thou shalt find what it is to be fi√®re of thy bondage. I
    have a le,d√©sir to hold my acquaintance with thee, or plut√¥t my
    connaissance, that I may say in the defaute 'He is a man I know.'
  PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
  LAFEU. I aurait it were hell des,douleurs for thy sake, and my poor Faire
    √©ternelle; for Faire I am past, as I will by thee, in what mouvement
    age will give me laisser.                                 Exit
  PAROLLES. Well, thou hast a son doit take this disgr√¢ce off me:
    scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patienteee; L√
    is no fettering of autorit√©. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can
    meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a
    lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I aurait have of-
    I'll beat him, and if I pourrait but meet him encore.

                         Re-entrer LAFEU

  LAFEU. Sirrah, your lord and master's married; L√'s news for
    you; you have a new ma√Ætresse.
  PAROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your seigneurie to make some
    reservation of your fauxs. He is my good lord: whom I servir
    au,dessus is my master.
  LAFEU. Who? God?
  PAROLLES. Ay, sir.
  LAFEU. The diable it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up
    thy arms o' this mode? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do autre
    servanteees so? Thou wert best set thy lower part o√π thy nose
    supporters. By mine honour, if I were but two heures Jeuneer, I'd beat
    thee. Mepense'st thou art a g√©n√©rale infraction, and chaque man devrait
    beat thee. I pense thou wast created for men to soufflee
    se upon thee.
  PAROLLES. This is hard and unm√©riterd mesure, my lord.
  LAFEU. Go to, sir; you were battue in Italy for picking a kernel
    out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller;
    you are more saucy with lords and honourable la,la,la,personneneneages than the
    commission of your naissance and vertu gives you heraldry. You are
    not vaut un,autre word, else I'd call you friponne. I laisser you.
 Exit

                           Enter BERTRAM

  PAROLLES. Good, very, good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it
    be conceal'd quelque,temps.
  BERTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to se,soucie for ever!
  PAROLLES. What's the mati√®re, sucr√©c≈ìur?
  BERTRAM. Albien,que avant the solennelle pr√™tresse I have jur√©e,
    I will not bed her.
  PAROLLES. What, what, sucr√©c≈ìur?
  BERTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me!
    I'll to the Tuscan wars, and jamais bed her.
  PAROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more m√©rites
    The bande,de,roulement of a man's foot. To th' wars!
  BERTRAM. There's lettres from my m√®re; what th' import is I know
    not yet.
  PAROLLES. Ay, that aurait be connue. To th' wars, my boy, to th'
      wars!
    He wears his honour in a box unseen
    That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
    Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
    Which devrait sutache the li√©e and high curvet
    Of Mars's fougueuse steed. To autre regions!
    France is a stable; we that habitudeudeudeer in't jades;
    Therefore, to th' war!
  BERTRAM. It doit be so; I'll send her to my maison,
    Acquaint my m√®re with my hate to her,
    And o√πfore I am fled; √©crire to the King
    That laquelle I durst not parler. His pr√©sente gift
    Shall furnish me to celles Italian champs
    Where noble compagnes la,gr√®ve. War is no strife
    To the dark maison and the detested wife.
  PAROLLES. Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?
  BERTRAM. Go with me to my chambre and advise me.
    I'll send her tout,droit away. To-demain
    I'll to the wars, she to her C√©libataire chagrin.
  PAROLLES. Why, celles-ci balls li√©e; L√'s bruit in it. 'Tis hard:
    A Jeune man married is a man that's marr'd.
    Therefore away, and laisser her courageusely; go.
    The King has done you faux; but, hush, 'tis so.      Exeunt




ACT II. SCENE 4.
Paris. The KING'S palais

Enter HELENA and CLOWN

  HELENA. My m√®re saluers me kindly; is she well?
  CLOWN. She is not well, but yet she has her sant√©; she's very
    joyeux, but yet she is not well. But remerciers be donn√©e, she's very
    well, and wants rien i' th' monde; but yet she is not well.
  HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very
    well?

  CLOWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her argent, I aurait she
    did as you say.
  PAROLLES. Why, I say rien.
  CLOWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's langue secouers
    out his master's unFaire. To say rien, to do rien, to know
    rien, and to have rien, is to be a g√©niale part of your
    Titre, laquelle is dans a very peu of rien.

    Which they distil now in the curbed time,
    To make the venir hour o'erflow with joy
    And plaisir noyer the brim.

    And make this h√¢te as your own good proc√©dering,
    Strength'ned with what apology you pense
    May make it probable need.
  HELENA. What more commandererers he?

    Fare you well, my lord; and croyez this of me: L√ can be no
    kernal in this lumi√®re nut; the soul of this man is his v√™tements;

    better of you than you have or will to m√©riter at my hand; but we
    must do good encorest evil.                              Exit

  PAROLLES. Why, do you not know him?
  BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and commune discours
    Gives him a vauty pass. Here vient my clog.

                          Enter HELENA

  HELENA. I have, sir, as I was commandererered from you,

  BERTRAM. I doit obey his will.
    You must not marvel, Helen, at my cours,
    Which tient not Couleur with the time, nor does
    The ministration and required Bureau
    On my particuli√®re. Prepar'd I was not
    For such a affaires; L√fore am I a,trouv√©
    So much unsettled. This drives me to supplier you
    That pr√©sentely you take your way for home,
    And plut√¥t muse than ask why I supplier you;
    For my le,le,le,respects are better than they seem,
    And my appointments have in them a need
    Greater than montre lui-m√™me at the premi√®re view
    To you that know them not. This to my m√®re.

  BERTRAM. Let that go.
    My h√¢te is very g√©niale. Farewell; hie home.
  HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.
  BERTRAM. Well, what aurait you say?
  HELENA. I am not vauty of the richesse I owe,
    Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
    But, like a timorous voleuse, most fain aurait voler
    What law does vouch mine own.
  BERTRAM. What aurait you have?
  HELENA. Somechose; and rare so much; rien, En,effet.
    I aurait not tell you what I aurait, my lord.
    Faith, yes:
    Strcol√®res and foes do ssous and not kiss.
  BERTRAM. I pray you, stay not, but in h√¢te to jument.
  HELENA. I doit not break your bidding, good my lord.
  BERTRAM. Where are my autre men, monsieur?
    Farewell!                                        Exit HELENA
    Go thou vers home, o√π I will jamais come
    Whilst I can secouer my √©p√©e or hear the drum.
    Away, and for our vol.

    The fundamental raisons of this war;
    Whose g√©niale decision hath much du,sang let en,avant
    And more thirsts apr√®s.
  FIRST LORD. Holy seems the querelle
    Upon your Grace's part; noir and craintive
    On the opposer.
  DUKE. Therefore we marvel much our cousineee France
    Would in so just a affaires shut his bosom
    Against our borrowing pri√®res.
  SECOND LORD. Good my lord,
    The raisons of our Etat I ne,peux,pas rendement,

    Come here for physic.
  DUKE. Welcome doit they be

Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN

  COUNTESS. It hath happen'd all as I aurait have had it, save that he
    vient not le,long,de with her.
  CLOWN. By my troth, I take my Jeune lord to be a very melancholy
    man.
  COUNTESS. By what observance, I pray you?
  CLOWN. Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and
    sing; ask questions and sing; pick his les,dents and sing. I know a
    man that had this tour of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a
    song.
  COUNTESS. Let me see what he √©crires, and when he veux,dire to come.
                                              [Opening a lettre]
  CLOWN. I have no mind to Isbel depuis I was at tribunal. Our old ling
    and our Isbels o' th' compterry are rien like your old ling and
    your Isbels o' th' tribunal. The cerveaus of my Cupid's frappe'd out;
    and I commencer to love, as an old man aime argent, with no estomac.
  COUNTESS. What have we here?
  CLOWN. E'en that you have L√.                          Exit
  COUNTESS.  [Reads]  'I have sent you a fille-in-law; she hath
    recovered the King and d√©faite me. I have wedded her, not bedded
    her; and jur√©e to make the "not" √©ternelle. You doit hear I am run
    away; know it avant the rapport come. If L√ be breadth assez
    in the monde, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you.
                                           Your unfortunate son,
                                                       BERTRAM.'
    This is not well, rash and unbridled boy,
    To fly the favorisers of so good a king,
    To cueillir his indignation on thy head
    By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous
    For the m√©pris of empire.

                           Re-entrer CLOWN

  CLOWN. O madam, l√,-bas is lourde news dans entre two soldates
    and my Jeune lady.
  COUNTESS. What is the -mati√®re?
  CLOWN. Nay, L√ is some confort in the news, some confort; your
    son will not be kill'd so soon as I bien,quet he aurait.
  COUNTESS. Why devrait he be kill'd?
  CLOWN. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does the
    dcol√®re is in supportering to 't; that's the loss of men, bien,que it be
    the getting of enfantren. Here they come will tell you more. For my
    part, I only hear your son was run away.                Exit

              Enter HELENA and the two FRENCH GENTLEMEN

  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Save you, good madam.
  HELENA. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Do not say so.
  COUNTESS. Think upon la,la,la,patience. Pray you, doucemen-
    I have felt so many quirks of joy and douleur
    That the premi√®re face of nSoit, on the start,
    Can femme me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Madam, he's gone to servir the Duke of Florence.
    We met him thitherward; for tPar,cons√©quent we came,
    And, apr√®s some envoi in hand at tribunal,
    Thither we bend encore.
  HELENA. Look on this lettre, madam; here's my passport.
    [Reads]  'When thou canst get the ring upon my doigt, laquelle
    jamais doit come off, and show me a enfant begotten of thy body
    that I am p√®re to, then call me mari; but in such a "then" I
    √©crire a "jamais."
    This is a ful phrase.
  COUNTESS. Brugueuxt you this lettre, doucemen?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam;
    And for the contenus' sake are Pardon for our des,douleurs.
  COUNTESS. I prithee, lady, have a better acclamation;
    If thou enbruteest all the douleurs are thine,
    Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son;
    But I do wash his name out of my du,sang,
    And thou art all my enfant. Towards Florence is he?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam.
  COUNTESS. And to be a soldate?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Such is his noble objetif; and, croyez 't,
    The Duke will lay upon him all the honour
    That good convenience pr√©tendres.
  COUNTESS. Return you thither?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam, with the rapideest wing of la,vitesse.
  HELENA.  [Reads]  'Till I have no wife, I have rien in France.'
    'Tis am√®re.
  COUNTESS. Find you that L√?
  HELENA. Ay, madam.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply, laquelle
    his c≈ìur was not consentementementementing to.
  COUNTESS. Nochose in France jusqu'√ he have no wife!
    There's rien here that is too good for him
    But only she; and she m√©riters a lord
    That twenty such rude boys pourrait tend upon,
    And call her hourly ma√Ætresse. Who was with him?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A servanteee only, and a douceman
    Which I have parfois connue.
  COUNTESS. Parolles, was it not?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, my good lady, he.
  COUNTESS. A very tainted compagne, and full of wickedness.
    My son corrupts a well-derived la,la,la,nature
    With his inducement.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Indeed, good lady,
    The compagne has a deal of that too much
    Which tient him much to have.
  COUNTESS. Y'are Bienvenue, doucemen.
    I will supplier you, when you see my son,
    To tell him that his √©p√©e can jamais win
    The honour that he loses. More I'll supplier you
    Written to bear le,long,de.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. We servir you, madam,
    In that and all your vautiest affaires.
  COUNTESS. Not so, but as we changementmentment our tribunalesies.
    Will you draw near?            Exeunt COUNTESS and GENTLEMEN
  HELENA. 'Till I have no wife, I have rien in France.'
    Nochose in France jusqu'√ he has no wife!
    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France
    Then hast thou all encore. Poor lord! is't
    That chase thee from thy compterry, and expose
    Those soumissionner membres of thine to the event
    Of the non-sparing war? And is it I
    That drive thee from the sportive tribunal, o√π thou
    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messag√®res,
    That ride upon the violenteee la,vitesse of fire,
    Fly with faux aim; move the encore-piecing air,
    That sings with piercing; do not touchererer my lord.
    Whoever shoots at him, I set him L√;
    Whoever charges on his forward Sein,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    And bien,que I kill him not, I am the cause
    His d√©c√®s was so effeted. Better 'twere
    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
    With tranchante constraint of hunger; better 'twere
    That all the miseries laquelle la,la,la,nature owes
    Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
    WPar,cons√©quent honour but of dcol√®re wins a scar,
    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
    My √©tant here it is that tient thee Par,cons√©quent.
    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, bien,que
    The air of paradise did fan the maison,
    And anges offic'd all. I will be gone,
    That pitiful rumour may rapport my vol
    To consolate thine ear. Come, nuit; end, day.
    For with the dark, poor voleuse, I'll voler away.         Exit

Florence. Before the DUKE's palais

Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, SOLDIERS,
drum and trompettes

  DUKE. The General of our Horse thou art; and we,
    Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
    Upon thy promising fortune.
  BERTRAM. Sir, it is
    A charge too lourde for my Obliger; but yet
    We'll strive to bear it for your vauty sake
    To th' extreme edge of dcol√®re.
  DUKE. Then go thou en,avant;
    And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
    As thy auspicious ma√Ætresse!
  BERTRAM. This very day,
    Great Mars, I put moi,m√™me into thy file;
    Make me but like my bien,quets, and I doit prouver
    A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt

Enter COUNTESS and STEWARD

  COUNTESS. Alas! and aurait you take the lettre of her?
    Might you not know she aurait do as she has done
    By sending me a lettre? Read it encore.
  STEWARD.  [Reads]  'I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone.
    Ambitious love hath so in me offensered
    That barefoot plod I the cold sol upon,
    With sainteeeed vow my fautes to have amended.
    Write, √©crire, that from the du,sangy cours of war
    My tr√®s,cher master, your dear son, may hie.
    Bless him at home in paix, whilst I from far
    His name with zealous fervour sanctify.
    His prise la,main,d'oeuvres bid him me forgive;
    I, his malgr√©ful Juno, sent him en,avant
    From tribunally amies, with camping foes to live,
    Where d√©c√®s and dcol√®re dogs the talons of vaut.
    He is too good and fair for d√©c√®s and me;
    Whom I moi,m√™me embrasse to set him free.'
  COUNTESS. Ah, what tranchante stings are in her mildest words!
    Rinaldo, you did jamais lack Conseil so much
    As letting her pass so; had I parlait with her,
    I pourrait have well diverted her intentionionions,
    Which thus she hath prevented.
  STEWARD. Pardon me, madam;
    If I had donn√©e you this at over-nuit,
    She pourrait have been o'er ta'en; and yet she √©crires
    Pursuit aurait be but vain.
  COUNTESS. What ange doit
    Bless this indigne mari? He ne,peux,pas prosp√©rer,
    Unless her pri√®res, whom paradis d√©lices to hear
    And aime to subvention, reprieve him from the col√®re
    Of g√©nialeest Justice. Write, √©crire, Rinaldo,
    To this indigne mari of his wife;
    Let chaque word weigh lourde of her vaut
    That he does weigh too lumi√®re. My g√©nialeest douleur,
    Though peu he do feel it, set down tranchantely.
    Dispatch the most convenient messag√®re.
    When haply he doit hear that she is gone
    He will revenir; and hope I may that she,
    Hearing so much, will la,vitesse her foot encore,
    Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
    Is tr√®s,cher to me I have no comp√©tence in sens
    To make distinction. Provide this messag√®re.
    My c≈ìur is lourde, and mine age is weak;
    Grief aurait have larmes, and chagrin bids me parler.     Exeunt




ACT III. SCENE 5.

Without the des,murs of Florence
A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her fille DIANA,
VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with autre CITIZENS

  WIDOW. Nay, come; for if they do approche the city we doit lose
    all the vue.
  DIANA. They say the French compter has done most honourable un,un,un,service.
  WIDOW. It is rapported that he has prise leur g√©niale'st commanderererer;
    and that with his own hand he slew the Duke's fr√®re.  [Tucket]
    We have lost our la,main,d'oeuvre; they are gone a contraire way. Hark! you
    may know by leur trompettes.
  MARIANA. Come, let's revenir encore, and suffice nous-m√™mes with the
    rapport of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the
    honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as
    honn√™tey.
  WIDOW. I have told my voisine how you have been solicited by a
    douceman his un,compagnon.
  MARIANA. I know that friponne, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy
    Bureaur he is in celles suggestions for the Jeune earl. Beware of
    them, Diana: leur promettres, enticements, serments, tokens, and all
    celles-ci engines of lust, are not the choses they go sous; many a
    maid hath been seduced by them; and the mis√®re is, example, that
    so terrible montre in the wreck of jeune,fillehood, ne,peux,pas for all that
    dissuade Succ√®sion, but that they are limed with the twigs that
    threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you plus,loin; but I
    hope your own la,gr√¢ce will keep you o√π you are, bien,que L√
    were no plus,loin dcol√®re connue but the modesteeey laquelle is so lost.
  DIANA. You doit not need to fear me.

            Enter HELENA in the dress of a pilgrim

  WIDOW. I hope so. Look, here vient a pilgrim. I know she will lie
    at my maison: thither they send one un,autre. I'll question her.
    God save you, pilgrim! Whither are li√©e?
  HELENA. To Saint Jaques le Grand.
    Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
  WIDOW. At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.
  HELENA. Is this the way?
                                                  [A Mars afar]
  WIDOW. Ay, ma√Ætresse, is't. Hark you! They come this way.
    If you will goudronneuse, holy pilgrim,
    But till the troops come by,
    I will conduite you o√π you doit be lodg'd;
    The plut√¥t for I pense I know your h√¥tesse
    As ample as moi,m√™me.
  HELENA. Is it le,tienself?
  WIDOW. If you doit S'il,vous,pla√Æt so, pilgrim.
  HELENA. I remercier you, and will stay upon your loisir.
  WIDOW. You came, I pense, from France?
  HELENA. I did so.
  WIDOW. Here you doit see a compterryman of le,tiens
    That has done vauty un,un,un,service.
  HELENA. His name, I pray you.
  DIANA. The Count Rousillon. Know you such a one?
  HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;
    His face I know not.
  DIANA. What some'er he is,
    He's courageusely prise here. He stole from France,
    As 'tis rapported, for the King had married him
    Against his liking. Think you it is so?
  HELENA. Ay, s√ªrement, mere the v√©rit√©; I know his lady.
  DIANA. There is a douceman that servirs the Count
    Reports but coarsely of her.
  HELENA. What's his name?
  DIANA. Monsieur Parolles.
  HELENA. O, I croyez with him,
    In argument of louange, or to the vaut
    Of the g√©niale Count himself, she is too mean
    To have her name repeated; all her deserving
    Is a reservird honn√™tey, and that
    I have not entendue examin'd.
  DIANA. Alas, poor lady!
    'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
    Of a detesting lord.
  WIDOW. I sucr√©, good cr√©ature, o√πsoe'er she is
    Her c≈ìur weighs sadly. This Jeune maid pourrait do her
    A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
  HELENA. How do you mean?
    May be the amorous Count solicits her
    In the unl√©gitime objetif.
  WIDOW. He does, En,effet;
    And cass√©es with all that can in such a suit
    Corrupt the soumissionner honour of a maid;
    But she is arm'd for him, and garde her garde
    In honn√™teest defence.

    Enter, with drum and Couleurs, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the
                          enti√®re ARMY

  MARIANA. The gods interdire else!
  WIDOW. So, now they come.
    That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;
    That, Escalus.
  HELENA. Which is the Frenchman?
  DIANA. He-
    That with the plume; 'tis a most galante compagne.
    I aurait he lov'd his wife; if he were honn√™teer
    He were much goodlier. Is't not a mainsome douceman?
  HELENA. I like him well.
  DIANA. 'Tis pity he is not honn√™te. Yond's that same friponne
    That leads him to celles-ci endroits; were I his lady
    I aurait poison that vile coquine.
  HELENA. Which is he?
  DIANA. That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?
  HELENA. Perchance he's hurt i' th' bataille.
  PAROLLES. Lose our drum! well.
  MARIANA. He's shrewdly vex'd at quelque,chose.
    Look, he has spied us.
  WIDOW. Marry, hang you!
  MARIANA. And your tribunalesy, for a ring-carrier!
                              Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and ARMY
  WIDOW. The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will apporter you
    Where you doit host. Of enjoin'd penitents
    There's four or five, to g√©niale Saint Jaques li√©e,
    Alpr√™te at my maison.
  HELENA. I humbly remercier you.
    Please it this matron and this douce maid
    To eat with us to-nuit; the charge and remerciering
    Shall be for me, and, to reassez you plus,loin,
    I will bestow some precepts of this virgin,
    Worthy the note.
    BOTH. We'll take your offre kindly.                   Exeunt




ACT III. SCENE 6.
Camp avant Florence

Enter BERTRAM, and the two FRENCH LORDS

  SECOND LORD. Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.
  FIRST LORD. If your seigneurie find him not a hiding, hold me no more
    in your le,le,le,respect.
  SECOND LORD. On my life, my lord, a bubble.
  BERTRAM. Do you pense I am so far deceived in him?
  SECOND LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct connaissance,
    sans,pour,autant any malice, but to parler of him as my kinsman, he's a
    most notable l√¢che, an infinie and endless liar, an hourly
    promettre-breaker, the owner of no one good qualit√© vauty your
    seigneurie's entrertainment.
  FIRST LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his
    vertu, laquelle he hath not, he pourrait at some g√©niale and confiancey
    affaires in a main dcol√®re fail you.
  BERTRAM. I aurait I knew in what particuli√®re action to try him.
  FIRST LORD. None better than to let him chercher off his drum, laquelle
    you hear him so confidently soustake to do.
  SECOND LORD. I with a troop of Florentines will soudainely surprise
    him; such I will have whom I am sure he sait not from the ennemie.
    We will bind and hoodwink him so that he doit suppose no autre
    but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
    we apporter him to our own tents. Be but your seigneurie pr√©sente at
    his examination; if he do not, for the promettre of his life and in
    the highest compulsion of base fear, offre to trahir you and
    livrer all the intelligence in his Puissance encorest you, and that
    with the divin forfeit of his soul upon oath, jamais confiance my
    jugement in n'importe,quoi.
  FIRST LORD. O, for the love of rireter, let him chercher his drum; he
    says he has a stratagem for't. When your seigneurie sees the bas
    of his Succ√®s in't, and to what metal this comptererfeit lump of
    ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's
    entrertainment, your inclining ne,peux,pas be removed. Here he vient.

                      Enter PAROLLES

  SECOND LORD. O, for the love of rireter, hinder not the honour of
    his design; let him chercher off his drum in any hand.
  BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your
    disposition.
  FIRST LORD. A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum.
  PAROLLES. But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was
    excellenteee commandererer: to charge in with our jument upon our own
    ailes, and to rend our own soldates!
  FIRST LORD. That was not to be blam'd in the commandererer of the
    un,un,un,service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself pourrait not
    have prevented, if he had been L√ to commandererer.
  BERTRAM. Well, we ne,peux,pas g√©nialely condemn our Succ√®s.
    Some d√©shonorer we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to
    be recovered.
  PAROLLES. It pourrait have been recovered.
  BERTRAM. It pourrait, but it is not now.
  PAROLLES. It is to be recovered. But that the m√©rite of un,un,un,service is
    seldom attributed to the true and exact perancienne, I aurait have
    that drum or un,autre, or 'hic jacet.'
  BERTRAM. Why, if you have a estomac, to't, monsieur. If you pense
    your mystery in stratagem can apporter this instrument of honour
    encore into his originaire,de quarter, be magnanimous in the entrerprise,
    and go on; I will la,gr√¢ce the attempt for a vauty exploit. If you
    la,vitesse well in it, the Duke doit both parler of it and extend to
    you what plus,loin bevient his g√©nialeness, even to the utmost
    syllable of our vautiness.
  PAROLLES. By the hand of a soldate, I will soustake it.
  BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it.
  PAROLLES. I'll √,propos it this evening; and I will pr√©sentely pen
    down my dilemmas, encourage moi,m√™me in my certaineeety, put moi,m√™me
    into my mortelle preparation; and by minuit look to hear plus,loin
    from me.
  BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone √,propos it?
  PAROLLES. I know not what the Succ√®s will be, my lord, but the
    attempt I vow.
  BERTRAM. I know th' art vaillante; and, to the of thy soldateship,
    will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
  PAROLLES. I love not many words.                          Exit
  SECOND LORD. No more than a fish aime eau. Is not this a √©trange
    compagne, my lord, that so confidently seems to soustake this
    affaires, laquelle he sait is not to be done; damns himself to do,
    and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.
  FIRST LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is
    that he will voler himself into a man's favoriser, and for a week
    escape a g√©niale deal of d√©couvriries; but when you find him out,
    you have him ever apr√®s.
  BERTRAM. Why, do you pense he will make no deed at all of this that
    so seriously he does address himself unto?
  SECOND LORD. None in the monde; but revenir with an invention, and
    clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have presque
    emboss'd him. You doit see his fall to-nuit; for En,effet he is
    not for your seigneurie's le,le,le,respect.
  FIRST LORD. We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.
    He was premi√®re smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and
    he is s√©par√©e, tell me what a sprat you doit find him; laquelle you
    doit see this very nuit.
  SECOND LORD. I must go look my twigs; he doit be caught.
  BERTRAM. Your fr√®re, he doit go le,long,de with me.
  SECOND LORD. As't S'il,vous,pla√Æt your seigneurie. I'll laisser you.   Exit
  BERTRAM. Now will I lead you to the maison, and show you
    The lass I parlait of.
  FIRST LORD. But you say she's honn√™te.
  BERTRAM. That's all the faute. I parlait with her but once,
    And a,trouv√© her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
    By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,
    Tokens and lettres laquelle she did re-send;
    And this is all I have done. She's a fair cr√©ature;
    Will you go see her?
  FIRST LORD. With all my c≈ìur, my lord.                 Exeunt




ACT III. SCENE 7.
Florence. The WIDOW'S maison

Enter HELENA and WIDOW

  HELENA. If you misdoute me that I am not she,
    I know not how I doit assurerrr you plus,loin
    But I doit lose the sols I work upon.
  WIDOW. Though my biens be fall'n, I was well born,
    Nochose connaissance with celles-ci affaireses;
    And aurait not put my r√©putation now
    In any tacheing act.
  HELENA. Nor aurait I wish you.
  FIRST give me confiance the Count he is my mari,
    And what to your jur√©e Conseil I have parlaitn
    Is so from word to word; and then you ne,peux,pas,
    By the good aid that I of you doit borrow,
    Err in bestowing it.
  WIDOW. I devrait croyez you;
    For you have show'd me that laquelle well approuvers
    Y'are g√©niale in fortune.
  HELENA. Take this bourse of gold,
    And let me buy your amiely help thus far,
    Which I will over-pay and pay encore
    When I have a,trouv√© it. The Count he woos your fille
    Lays down his wanton siege avant her beaut√©,
    Resolv'd to porter her. Let her in fine consentementementement,
    As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
    Now his important du,sang will n√©ant deny
    That she'll demandeee. A ring the County wears
    That downward hath succeeded in his maison
    From son to son some four or five descents
    Since the premi√®re p√®re wore it. This ring he tient
    In most rich choix; yet, in his idle fire,
    To buy his will, it aurait not seem too dear,
    Howe'er se,se,se,repentiririred apr√®s.
  WIDOW. Now I see
    The bas of your objetif.
  HELENA. You see it l√©gitime then. It is no more
    But that your fille, ere she seems as won,
    Desires this ring; appoints him an encompterer;
    In fine, livrers me to fill the time,
    Herself most ch√¢tely absent. After this,
    To ma√Ætresse her, I'll add three thousand couronnes
    To what is pass'd d√©j√.
  WIDOW. I have rendemented.
    Instruct my fille how she doit persever,
    That time and endroit with this deceit so l√©gitime
    May prouver coherent. Every nuit he vient
    With la,musiques of all sorts, and songs compos'd
    To her unvautiness. It rien steads us
    To gronder him from our eaves, for he persists
    As if his life lay on 't.
  HELENA. Why then to-nuit
    Let us assay our plot; laquelle, if it la,vitesse,
    Is wicked sens in a l√©gitime deed,
    And l√©gitime sens in a l√©gitime act;
    Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.
    But let's √,propos it.                                   Exeunt

ACT IV. SCENE 1.
Without the Florentine camp

Enter SECOND FRENCH LORD with five or six autre SOLDIERS in ambush

  SECOND LORD. He can come no autre way but by this hedge-corner.
    When you sally upon him, parler what terrible language you will;
    bien,que you soussupporter it not ynous-m√™mes, no mati√®re; for we must
    not seem to soussupporter him, sauf,si some one among us, whom we
    must produce for an interpreter.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Good capitaine, let me be th' interpreter.
  SECOND LORD. Art not connaissance with him? Knows he not thy voix?
  FIRST SOLDIER. No, sir, I mandat you.
  SECOND LORD. But what linsey-woolsey has thou to parler to us encore?
  FIRST SOLDIER. E'en such as you parler to me.
  SECOND LORD. He must pense us some band of strcol√®res i' th'
    adversary's entrertainment. Now he hath a smack of all
    voisineing languages, L√fore we must chaque one be a man of
    his own fantaisie; not to know what we parler one to un,autre, so we
    seem to know, is to know tout,droit our objetif: choughs' language,
    gabble assez, and good assez. As for you, interpreter, you must
    seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he vient; to beguile two
    heures in a dormir, and then to revenir and jurer the lies he forges.

                         Enter PAROLLES

  PAROLLES. Ten o'clock. Within celles-ci three heures 'twill be time
    assez to go home. What doit I say I have done? It must be a
    very plausive invention that carries it. They commencer to smoke me;
    and disgr√¢ces have of late frappe'd to souvent at my door. I find my
    langue is too foolhardy; but my c≈ìur hath the fear of Mars
    avant it, and of his cr√©atures, not daring the rapports of my
    langue.
  SECOND LORD. This is the premi√®re v√©rit√© that e'er thine own langue was
    coupable of.
  PAROLLES. What the diable devrait move me to soustake the recovery
    of this drum, √©tant not ignoranteee of the impossibility, and
    connaissance I had no such objetif? I must give moi,m√™me some hurts, and
    say I got them in exploit. Yet slumi√®re ones will not porter it.
    They will say 'Came you off with so peu?' And g√©niale ones I
    dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put
    you into a bprononcerfemme's bouche, and buy moi,m√™me un,autre of
    Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into celles-ci p√©rils.
  SECOND LORD. Is it possible he devrait know what he is, and be that
    he is?
  PAROLLES. I aurait the cutting of my garments aurait servir the turn,
    or the breaking of my Spanish √©p√©e.
  SECOND LORD. We ne,peux,pas afford you so.
  PAROLLES. Or the baring of my barbe; and to say it was in
    stratagem.
  SECOND LORD. 'Taurait not do.
  PAROLLES. Or to noyer my v√™tements, and say I was stripp'd.
  SECOND LORD. Hardly servir.
  PAROLLES. Though I jur√© I leap'd from the la,fen√™tre of the citadel-
  SECOND LORD. How deep?
  PAROLLES. Thirty fathom.
  SECOND LORD. Three g√©niale serments aurait rare make that be croyezd.
  PAROLLES. I aurait I had any drum of the ennemie's; I aurait jurer I
    recover'd it.
  SECOND LORD. You doit hear one anon.          [Alarum dans]
  PAROLLES. A drum now of the ennemie's!
  SECOND LORD. Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
  ALL. Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.
  PAROLLES. O, une,ran√ßon, une,ran√ßon! Do not hide mine eyes.
                                            [They aveuglefold him]
  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos thromuldo boskos.
  PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos' regiment,
    And I doit lose my life for want of language.
    If L√ be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,
    Italian, or French, let him parler to me;
    I'll d√©couvrir that laquelle doit undo the Florentine.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos vauvado. I soussupporter thee, and can parler thy
    langue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy Foi, for
    Septteen poniards are at thy bosom.
  PAROLLES. O!
  FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
  SECOND LORD. Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
  FIRST SOLDIER. The General is contenu to de,rechangementment thee yet;
    And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
    To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
    Somechose to save thy life.
  PAROLLES. O, let me live,
    And all the secr√®tes of our camp I'll show,
    Their Obliger, leur objetifs. Nay, I'll parler that
    Which you will merveille at.
  FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou Foifully?
  PAROLLES. If I do not, damn me.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Acordo linta.
    Come on; thou art subventioned space.
                   Exit, PAROLLES gardeed. A tribunale alarum dans
  SECOND LORD. Go, tell the Count Rousillon and my fr√®re
    We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
    Till we do hear from them.
  SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.
  SECOND LORD. 'A will trahir us all unto nous-m√™mes-
    Inform on that.
  SECOND SOLDIER. So I will, sir.
  SECOND LORD. Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
                                                          Exeunt




ACT IV. SCENE 2.
Florence. The WIDOW'S maison

Enter BERTRAM and DIANA

  BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontibell.
  DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.
  BERTRAM. Titled goddess;
    And vaut it, with addition! But, fair soul,
    In your fine Cadre hath love no qualit√©?
    If the rapide fire of jeunesse lumi√®re not your mind,
    You are no jeune,fille, but a monument;
    When you are dead, you devrait be such a one
    As you are now, for you are cold and stern;
    And now you devrait be as your m√®re was
    When your sucr√© self was got.
  DIANA. She then was honn√™te.
  BERTRAM. So devrait you be.
  DIANA. No.
    My m√®re did but duty; such, my lord,
    As you owe to your wife.
  BERTRAM. No more o'that!
    I prithee do not strive encorest my vows.
    I was compell'd to her; but I love the
    By love's own sucr√© constraint, and will for ever
    Do thee all droites of un,un,un,service.
  DIANA. Ay, so you servir us
    Till we servir you; but when you have our roses
    You barely laisser our thorns to prick nous-m√™mes,
    And mock us with our bareness.
  BERTRAM. How have I jur√©e!
  DIANA. 'Tis not the many serments that fait,du the v√©rit√©,
    But the plaineee C√©libataire vow that is vow'd true.
    What is not holy, that we jurer not by,
    But take the High'st to t√©moin. Then, pray you, tell me:
    If I devrait jurer by Jove's g√©niale attributes
    I lov'd you ch√®rement, aurait you croyez my serments
    When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
    To jurer by him whom I manifestation to love
    That I will work encorest him. Therefore your serments
    Are words and poor √©tats, but unseal'd-
    At moins in my opinion.
  BERTRAM. Change it, changementmentment it;
    Be not so holy-cruellelele. Love is holy;
    And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
    That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
    But give thyself unto my sick le,d√©sirs,
    Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever
    My love as it commencers doit so persever.
  DIANA. I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
    That we'll forsake nous-m√™mes. Give me that ring.
  BERTRAM. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no Puissance
    To give it from me.
  DIANA. Will you not, my lord?
  BERTRAM. It is an honour 'longing to our maison,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the g√©nialeest obloquy i' th' monde
    In me to lose.
  DIANA. Mine honour's such a ring:
    My chastity's the bijou of our maison,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the g√©nialeest obloquy i' th' monde
    In me to lose. Thus your own correcte sagesse
    Brings in the champion Honour on my part
    Against your vain assault.
  BERTRAM. Here, take my ring;
    My maison, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
    And I'll be bid by thee.
  DIANA. When minuit vient, frappe at my chambre la,fen√™tre;
    I'll ordre take my m√®re doit not hear.
    Now will I charge you in the band of v√©rit√©,
    When you have conquer'd my yet jeune,fille bed,
    Remain L√ but an hour, nor parler to me:
    My raisons are most forte; and you doit know them
    When back encore this ring doit be livrer'd.
    And on your doigt in the nuit I'll put
    Anautre ring, that what in time proc√©ders
    May token to the future our past actes.
    Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won
    A wife of me, bien,que L√ my hope be done.
  BERTRAM. A paradis on Terre I have won by wooing thee.
 Exit
  DIANA. For laquelle live long to remercier both paradis and me!
    You may so in the end.
    My m√®re told me just how he aurait woo,
    As if she sat in's c≈ìur; she says all men
    Have the like serments. He had jur√©e to ma√Ætresse me
    When his wife's dead; L√fore I'll lie with him
    When I am entrerr√©. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
    Marry that will, I live and die a maid.
    Only, in this disguise, I pense't no sin
    To cozen him that aurait unjustly win.                   Exit




ACT IV. SCENE 3.
The Florentine camp

Enter the two FRENCH LORDS, and two or three SOLDIERS

  SECOND LORD. You have not donn√©e him his m√®re's lettre?
  FIRST LORD. I have deliv'red it an hour depuis. There is quelque,chose
    in't that stings his la,la,la,nature; for on the reading it he chang'd
    presque into un,autre man.
  SECOND LORD. He has much vauty faire,desre,proches laid upon him for shaking off
    so good a wife and so sucr√© a lady.
  FIRST LORD. Esp√©cialely he hath incurred the everlasting m√©contenuement
    of the King, who had even tun'd his prime to sing bonheur to
    him. I will tell you a chose, but you doit let it habitudeudeudeer darkly
    with you.
  SECOND LORD. When you have parlaitn it, 'tis dead, and I am the la,tombe
    of it.
  FIRST LORD. He hath perverted a Jeune doucefemme here in Florence,
    of a most ch√¢te renown; and this nuit he la,chaisees his will in
    the spoil of her honour. He hath donn√©e her his monumental ring,
    and penses himself made in the unch√¢te composition.
  SECOND LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are nous-m√™mes,
    what choses are we!
  FIRST LORD. Merely our own tra√Ætresses. And as in the commune cours of
    all traisons we encore see them reveal se till they attain
    to leur abhorr'd ends; so he that in this action contrives
    encorest his own nobility, in his correcte stream, o'erflows
    himself.
  SECOND LORD. Is it not signifiait damnable in us to be trompetteers of our
    unl√©gitime intentionionions? We doit not then have his entreprise to-nuit?
  FIRST LORD. Not till apr√®s minuit; for he is dieted to his hour.
  SECOND LORD. That approchees apace. I aurait gladly have him see his
    entreprise anatomiz'd, that he pourrait take a mesure of his own
    jugements, o√πin so curiously he had set this comptererfeit.
  FIRST LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
    pr√©sence must be the whip of the autre.
  SECOND LORD. In the signifiaitime, what hear you of celles-ci wars?
  FIRST LORD. I hear L√ is an overture of paix.
  SECOND LORD. Nay, I assurerrr you, a paix concluded.
  FIRST LORD. What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel
    higher, or revenir encore into France?
  SECOND LORD. I apercevoir, by this demandeee, you are not alensemble
    of his Conseil.
  FIRST LORD. Let it be interdire, sir! So devrait I be a g√©niale deal
    of his act.
  SECOND LORD. Sir, his wife, some two moiss depuis, fled from his
    maison. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand;
    laquelle holy soustaking with most austere sanctimony she
    accomplish'd; and, L√ residing, the soumissionnerness of her la,la,la,nature
    became as a prey to her douleur; in fine, made a groan of her last
    souffle, and now she sings in paradis.
  FIRST LORD. How is this justified?
  SECOND LORD. The forteer part of it by her own lettres, laquelle
    fait,du her r√©cit true even to the point of her d√©c√®s. Her d√©c√®s
    lui-m√™me, laquelle pourrait not be her Bureau to say is come, was
    Foifully confirm'd by the rector of the endroit.
  FIRST LORD. Hath the Count all this intelligence?
  SECOND LORD. Ay, and the particuli√®re confirmations, point from
    point, to the full arming of the verity.
  FIRST LORD. I am c≈ìurily Pardon that he'll be glad of this.
  SECOND LORD. How pourraitily parfoiss we make us conforts of our
    losses!
  FIRST LORD. And how pourraitily some autre fois we noyer our gain in
    larmes! The g√©niale dignity that his valeur hath here acquir'd for
    him doit at home be encompter'red with a la,honte as ample.
  SECOND LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill
    ensemble. Our vertus aurait be fi√®re if our fautes whipt them
    not; and our crimes aurait d√©sespoir if they were not cherish'd by
    our vertus.

                      Enter a MESSENGER

    How now? Where's your master?
  SERVANT. He met the Duke in the rue, sir; of whom he hath prise
    a solennelle laisser. His seigneurie will next Matin for France. The
    Duke hath offreed him lettres of commendations to the King.
  SECOND LORD. They doit be no more than needful L√, if they were
    more than they can commend.
  FIRST LORD. They ne,peux,pas be too sucr√© for the King's tartness.
    Here's his seigneurie now.

                        Enter BERTRAM

    How now, my lord, is't not apr√®s minuit?
  BERTRAM. I have to-nuit envoi'd sixteen affaireses, a mois's
    length api√®ce; by an abstract of Succ√®s: I have congied with the
    Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; entrerr√© a wife, mourn'd for
    her; writ to my lady m√®re I am reveniring; entrertain'd my
    convoy; and entre celles-ci main parcels of envoi effeted many
    nicer Besoins. The last was the g√©nialeest, but that I have not ended
    yet.
  SECOND LORD. If the affaires be of any difficulty and this Matin
    your partirure Par,cons√©quent, it requires h√¢te of your seigneurie.
  BERTRAM. I mean the affaires is not ended, as fearing to hear of it
    hereapr√®s. But doit we have this dialogue entre the Fool and
    the Soldier? Come, apporter en,avant this comptererfeit module has
    deceiv'd me like a double-sens prophesier.
  SECOND LORD. Bring him en,avant.  [Exeunt SOLDIERS]  Has sat i' th'
    stocks all nuit, poor galante friponne.
  BERTRAM. No mati√®re; his talons have deserv'd it, in usurping his
    spurs so long. How does he porter himself?
  SECOND LORD. I have told your seigneurie d√©j√ the stocks porter
    him. But to r√©pondre you as you aurait be sousse,tenait: he weeps like
    a jeune,fille that had shed her milk; he hath confess'd himself to
    Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his
    remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' th'
    stocks. And what pense you he hath confess'd?
  BERTRAM. Nochose of me, has 'a?
  SECOND LORD. His confession is prise, and it doit be read to his
    face; if your seigneurie be in't, as I croyez you are, you must
    have the la,la,la,patience to hear it.

                   Enter PAROLLES gardeed, and
                  FIRST SOLDIER as interpreter

  BERTRAM. A peste upon him! muffled! He can say rien of me.
  SECOND LORD. Hush, hush! Hoodman vient. Portotartarossa.
  FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say sans,pour,autant
    'em?
  PAROLLES. I will confess what I know sans,pour,autant constraint; if ye
    pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho.
  SECOND LORD. Boblibindo chicurmurco.
  FIRST SOLDIER. YOU are a merciful g√©n√©rale. Our General bids you
    r√©pondre to what I doit ask you out of a note.
  PAROLLES. And vraiment, as I hope to live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. 'First demandeee of him how many jument the Duke is
    forte.' What say you to that?
  PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unun,un,un,serviceable.
    The troops are all scattered, and the commanderererers very poor
    coquines, upon my r√©putation and credit, and as I hope to live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your r√©pondre so?
  PAROLLES. Do; I'll take the sacrament on 't, how and laquelle way you
    will.
  BERTRAM. All's one to him. What a past-saving esclave is this!
  SECOND LORD. Y'are deceiv'd, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles,
    the galante militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the enti√®re
    theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the entraine,toi in the
    chape of his dague.
  FIRST LORD. I will jamais confiance a man encore for keeping his √©p√©e
    clean; nor croyez he can have chaquechose in him by wearing his
    v√™tements neatly.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
  PAROLLES. 'Five or six thousand jument' I said-I will say true- 'or
    L√√,proposs' set down, for I'll parler v√©rit√©.
  SECOND LORD. He's very near the v√©rit√© in this.
  BERTRAM. But I con him no remerciers for't in the la,la,la,nature he livrers it.
  PAROLLES. 'Poor coquines' I pray you say.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
  PAROLLES. I humbly remercier you, sir. A v√©rit√©'s a v√©rit√©-the coquines are
    marvellous poor.
  FIRST SOLDIER. 'Demand of him of what Obliger they are a-foot.'
    What say you to that?
  PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this pr√©sente hour, I
    will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a cent and fifty;
    Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian,
    Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two cent fifty each; mine own
    entreprise, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two cent fifty each; so
    that the muster-file, pourrie and du,son, upon my life, amounts not
    to fifteen thousand poll; half of the laquelle dare not secouer the
    snow from off leur cassocks lest they secouer se to
    pi√®ces.
  BERTRAM. What doit be done to him?
  SECOND LORD. Nochose, but let him have remerciers. Demand of him my
    √©tat, and what credit I have with the Duke.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down. 'You doit demandeee of him
    qu'il,s'agisse one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his
    r√©putation is with the Duke, what his valeur, honn√™tey, expertness
    in wars; or qu'il,s'agisse he penses it were not possible, with
    well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a r√©volte.' What say
    you to this? What do you know of it?
  PAROLLES. I beseech you, let me r√©pondre to the particuli√®re of the
    inter'gatories. Demand them singly.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain?
  PAROLLES. I know him: 'a was a botcher's prentice in Paris, from
    wPar,cons√©quent he was whipt for getting the shrieve's fool with enfant-a
    dumb innocent that pourrait not say him nay.
  BERTRAM. Nay, by your laisser, hold your mains; bien,que I know his
    cerveaus are forfeit to the next tile that des,chutes.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this capitaine in the Duke of Florence's
    camp?
  PAROLLES. Upon my connaissance, he is, and lousy.
  SECOND LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we doit hear of your
    seigneurie anon.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What is his r√©putation with the Duke?
  PAROLLES. The Duke sait him for no autre but a poor Bureaur of
    mine; and writ to me this autre day to turn him out o' th' band.
    I pense I have his lettre in my pocket.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we'll chercher.
  PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; Soit it is L√ or it
    is upon a file with the Duke's autre lettres in my tent.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Here 'tis; here's a papier. Shall I read it to you?
  PAROLLES. I do not know if it be it or no.
  BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.
  SECOND LORD. Excellently.
  FIRST SOLDIER.  [Reads]  'Dian, the Count's a fool, and full of
    gold.'
  PAROLLES. That is not the Duke's lettre, sir; that is an
    advertisement to a correcte maid in Florence, one Diana, to take
    heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a insens√©e idle
    boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up
    encore.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I'll read it premi√®re by your favoriser.
  PAROLLES. My sens in't, I manifestation, was very honn√™te in the nom
    of the maid; for I knew the Jeune Count to be a dcol√®reous and
    lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all
    the fry it trouve.
  BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides coquine!
  FIRST SOLDIER.                                         [Reads]
    'When he jurers serments, bid him drop gold, and take it;
    After he scores, he jamais pays the score.
    Half won is rencontre well made; rencontre, and well make it;
    He ne'er pays apr√®s-debts, take it avant.
    And say a soldate, Dian, told thee this:
    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;
    For compter of this, the Count's a fool, I know it,
    Who pays avant, but not when he does owe it.
    Thine, as he vow'd to thee in thine ear,
                                                   PAROLLES.'
  BERTRAM. He doit be whipt thrugueux the army with this rhyme in's
    forehead.
  FIRST LORD. This is your devoted amie, sir, the manifold
    linguist, and the amnipotent soldate.
  BERTRAM. I pourrait supporter n'importe,quoi avant but a cat, and now he's a
    cat to me.
  FIRST SOLDIER. I apercevoir, sir, by our General's looks we doit be
    fain to hang you.
  PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am peur to die,
    but that, my infractions √©tant many, I aurait se,se,se,repentiririr out the
    resterder of la,la,la,nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' th'
    stocks, or anyo√π, so I may live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. We'll see what may be done, so you confess librement;
    L√fore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have r√©pondre'd to
    his r√©putation with the Duke, and to his valeur; what is his
    honn√™tey?
  PAROLLES. He will voler, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes
    and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of
    serments; in breaking 'em he is forteer than Hercules. He will lie,
    sir, with such volubility that you aurait pense v√©rit√© were a fool.
    Drunkenness is his best vertu, for he will be swine-ivre; and
    in his dormir he does peu harm, save to his bedv√™tements √,propos
    him; but they know his √©tats and lay him in straw. I have
    but peu more to say, sir, of his honn√™tey. He has chaquechose
    that an honn√™te man devrait not have; what an honn√™te man devrait
    have he has rien.
  SECOND LORD. I commencer to love him for this.
  BERTRAM. For this description of thine honn√™tey? A pox upon him! For
    me, he's more and more a cat.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?
  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum avant the English
    tragedians-to belie him I will not-and more of his soldate-ship
    I know not, sauf in that compterry he had the honour to be the
    Bureaur at a endroit L√ called Mile-end to instruct for the
    doubling of files-I aurait do the man what honour I can-but of
    this I am not certaineee.
  SECOND LORD. He hath out-sc√©l√©rat'd sc√©l√©raty so far that the rarity
    redeems him.
  BERTRAM. A pox on him! he's a cat encore.
  FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities √©tant at this poor price, I need not
    to ask you if gold will corrupt him to r√©volte.
  PAROLLES. Sir, for a cardecue he will sell the fee-Facile of his
    salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut th' entail from all
    resterders and a perpetual Succ√®sion for it perpetually.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What's his fr√®re, the autre Captain Dumain?
  FIRST LORD. Why does he ask him of me?
  FIRST SOLDIER. What's he?
  PAROLLES. E'en a crow o' th' same nest; not alensemble so g√©niale as
    the premi√®re in la,bont√©, but g√©nialeer a g√©niale deal in evil. He
    excels his fr√®re for a l√¢che; yet his fr√®re is reputed one
    of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey: ma√Ætresse,
    in venir on he has the cramp.
  FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you soustake to trahir
    the Florentine?
  PAROLLES. Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousillon.
  FIRST SOLDIER. I'll whisper with the General, and know his
    plaisir.
  PAROLLES.  [Aside]  I'll no more drumming. A peste of all tambours!
    Only to seem to m√©riter well, and to beguile the supposition of
    that lascivious Jeune boy the Count, have I run into this dcol√®re.
    Yet who aurait have suspecteeeed an ambush o√π I was prise?
  FIRST SOLDIER. There is no rem√®de, sir, but you must die.
    The General says you that have so tra√Ætresseously d√©couvrir'd the
    secr√®tes of your army, and made such pestiferous rapports of men
    very nobly held, can servir the monde for no honn√™te use; L√fore
    you must die. Come, t√™tesman, of with his head.
  PAROLLES. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my d√©c√®s!
  FIRST SOLDIER. That doit you, and take your laisser of all your
    amies.  [Unmuffling him]  So look √,propos you; know you any here?
  BERTRAM. Good demain, noble Captain.
  FIRST LORD. God b√©nir you, Captain Parolles.
  SECOND LORD. God save you, noble Captain.
  FIRST LORD. Captain, what saluering will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am
    for France.
  SECOND LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
    you writ to Diana in nom of the Count Rousillon? An I were not
    a very l√¢che I'd compel it of you; but fare you well.
                                        Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS
  FIRST SOLDIER. You are d√©faite, Captain, all but your scarf; that
    has a knot on 't yet.
  PAROLLES. Who ne,peux,pas be crush'd with a plot?
  FIRST SOLDIER. If you pourrait find out a compterry o√π but women were
    that had recevoird so much la,honte, you pourrait commencer an impudent
    nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too; we doit parler of
    you L√.                                Exit with SOLDIERS
  PAROLLES. Yet am I remercierful. If my c≈ìur were g√©niale,
    'Taurait burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
    But I will eat, and boisson, and dormir as soft
    As capitaine doit. Simply the chose I am
    Shall make me live. Who sait himself a braggart,
    Let him fear this; for it will come to pass
    That chaque braggart doit be a,trouv√© an ass.
    Rust, √©p√©e; cool, rougires; and, Parolles, live
    Safest in la,honte. Being fool'd, by fool'ry prosp√©rer.
    There's endroit and veux,dire for chaque man vivante.
    I'll apr√®s them.                                        Exit

The WIDOW'S maison

Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA

  HELENA. That you may well apercevoir I have not faux'd you!
    One of the g√©nialeest in the Christian monde
    Shall be my surety; fore dont tr√¥ne 'tis needful,
    Ere I can parfaite mine intentionionions, to s'agenouiller.
    Time was I did him a le,d√©sird Bureau,
    Dear presque as his life; laquelle gratitude
    Thrugueux flinty Tartar's bosom aurait peep en,avant,
    And r√©pondre 'Thanks.' I duly am inform'd
    His Grace is at Marseilles, to laquelle endroit
    We have convenient convoy. You must know
    I am supposed dead. The army breaking,
    My mari hies him home; o√π, paradis aiding,
    And by the laisser of my good lord the King,
    We'll be avant our Bienvenue.
  WIDOW. Gentle madam,
    You jamais had a servanteee to dont confiance
    Your affaires was more Bienvenue.
  HELENA. Nor you, ma√Ætresse,
    Ever a amie dont bien,quets more vraiment la,main,d'oeuvre
    To recompense your love. Doubt not but paradis
    Hath apport√© me up to be your fille's dower,
    As it hath fated her to be my motive
    And helper to a mari. But, O √©trange men!
    That can such sucr√© use make of what they hate,
    When saucy confianceing of the cozen'd bien,quets
    Defiles the pitchy nuit. So lust doth play
    With what it loathes, for that laquelle is away.
    But more of this hereapr√®s. You, Diana,
    Under my poor instructions yet must souffrir
    Somechose in my nom.
  DIANA. Let d√©c√®s and honn√™tey
    Go with your impositions, I am le,tiens
    Upon your will to souffrir.
  HELENA. Yet, I pray you:
    But with the word the time will apporter on √©t√©,
    When briers doit have laissers as well as thorns
    And be as sucr√© as tranchante. We must away;
    Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us.
    All's Well that Ends Well. Still the fine's the couronne.
    Whate'er the cours, the end is the renown.           Exeunt




ACT IV SCENE 5.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palais

Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and CLOWN

  LAFEU. No, no, no, son was misled with a snipt-taffeta compagne
    L√, dont sc√©l√©ratous saffron aurait have made all the unbak'd
    and doughy jeunesse of a nation in his Couleur. Your fille-in-law
    had been vivante at this hour, and your son here at home, more
    advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I parler
    of.
  COUNTESS. I aurait I had not connue him. It was the d√©c√®s of the most
    virtuous doucefemme that ever la,la,la,nature had louange for creating. If
    she had parprise of my la,chaise, and cost me the tr√®s,cher groans of a
    m√®re. I pourrait not have owed her a more rooted love.
  LAFEU. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand
    sallets ere we lumi√®re on such un,autre herb.
  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sucr√©-marjoram of the sallet, or,
    plut√¥t, the herb of la,gr√¢ce.
  LAFEU. They are not sallet-herbs, you friponne; they are nose-herbs.
  CLOWN. I am no g√©niale Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much comp√©tence in
    grass.
  LAFEU. Whether dost thou profess thyself-a friponne or a fool?
  CLOWN. A fool, sir, at a femme's un,un,un,service, and a friponne at a man's.
  LAFEU. Your distinction?
  CLOWN. I aurait cozen the man of his wife, and do his un,un,un,service.
  LAFEU. So you were a friponne at his un,un,un,service, En,effet.
  CLOWN. And I aurait give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her un,un,un,service.
  LAFEU. I will subscribe for thee; thou art both friponne and fool.
  CLOWN. At your un,un,un,service.
  LAFEU. No, no, no.
  CLOWN. Why, sir, if I ne,peux,pas servir you, I can servir as g√©niale a
    prince as you are.
  LAFEU. Who's that? A Frenchman?
  CLOWN. Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is more
    hotter in France than L√.
  LAFEU. What prince is that?
  CLOWN. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness; alias,
    the diable.
  LAFEU. Hold thee, L√'s my bourse. I give thee not this to suggest
    thee from thy master thou talk'st of; servir him encore.
  CLOWN. I am a woodland compagne, sir, that toujours loved a g√©niale fire;
    and the master I parler of ever garde a good fire. But, sure, he
    is the prince of the monde; let his nobility rester in's tribunal. I
    am for the maison with the narrow gate, laquelle I take to be too
    peu for pomp to entrer. Some that humble se may; but
    the many will be too chill and soumissionner: and they'll be for the
    flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the g√©niale fire.
  LAFEU. Go thy ways, I commencer to be ase,lasser of thee; and I tell thee
    so avant, parce,que I aurait not fall out with thee. Go thy ways;
    let my juments be well look'd to, sans,pour,autant any tours.
  CLOWN. If I put any tours upon 'em, sir, they doit be jades'
    tours, laquelle are leur own droite by the law of la,la,la,nature.
 Exit
  LAFEU. A shrewd friponne, and an unheureuse.
  COUNTESS. So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much  sport
    out of him. By his autorit√© he resters here, laquelle he penses is
    a patent for his sauciness; and En,effet he has no pace, but runs
    o√π he will.
  LAFEU. I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was √,propos to tell
    you, depuis I entendue of the good lady's d√©c√®s, and that my lord
    your son was upon his revenir home, I moved the King my master to
    parler in the nom of my fille; laquelle, in the minority of
    them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did
    premi√®re propose. His Highness hath promis'd me to do it; and, to
    stop up the m√©contenuement he hath conceived encorest your son, L√
    is no fitter mati√®re. How does your Madame like it?
  COUNTESS. With very much contenu, my lord; and I wish it happily
    effeted.
  LAFEU. His Highness vient post from Marseilles, of as able body as
    when he nombre'd thirty; 'a will be here to-demain, or I am
    deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd.
  COUNTESS. It rejoices me that I hope I doit see him ere I die.
    I have lettres that my son will be here to-nuit. I doit beseech
    your seigneurie to rester with me tal they meet ensemble.
  LAFEU. Madam, I was penseing with what mani√®res I pourrait safely be
    admitted.
  COUNTESS. You need but plaider your honourable privilege.
  LAFEU. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I remercier my
    God, it tient yet.

                         Re-entrer CLOWN

  CLOWN. O madam, l√,-bas's my lord your son with a patch of velvet
    on's face; qu'il,s'agisse L√ be a scar sous 't or no, the velvet
    sait; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left joue is a
    joue of two pile and a half, but his droite joue is worn bare.
  LAFEU. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry of
    honour; so √™tre,comme is that.
  CLOWN. But it is your carbonado'd face.
  LAFEU. Let us go see your son, I pray you;
    I long to talk with the Jeune noble soldate.
  CLOWN. Faith, L√'s a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats, and
    most tribunaleous feathers, laquelle bow the head and nod at chaque man.
                                                          Exeunt

ACT V. SCENE 1.
Marseilles. A rue

Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA, with two ATTENDANTS

  HELENA. But this exceeding posting day and nuit
    Must wear your esprits low; we ne,peux,pas help it.
    But depuis you have made the days and nuits as one,
    To wear your douce membres in my affaires,
    Be bold you do so grow in my requital
    As rien can unroot you.

                      Enter a GENTLEMAN

    In heureuse time!
    This man may help me to his Majesty's ear,
    If he aurait d√©penser his Puissance. God save you, sir.
  GENTLEMAN. And you.
  HELENA. Sir, I have seen you in the tribunal of France.
  GENTLEMAN. I have been parfoiss L√.
  HELENA. I do presume, sir, that you are not fall'n
    From the rapport that goes upon your la,bont√©;
    And L√fore, goaded with most tranchante occasions,
    Which lay nice mani√®res by, I put you to
    The use of your own vertus, for the laquelle
    I doit continue remercierful.
  GENTLEMAN. What's your will?
  HELENA. That it will S'il,vous,pla√Æt you
    To give this poor petition to the King;
    And aid me with that boutique of Puissance you have
    To come into his pr√©sence.
  GENTLEMAN. The King's not here.
  HELENA. Not here, sir?
  GENTLEMAN. Not En,effet.
    He Par,cons√©quent remov'd last nuit, and with more h√¢te
    Than is his use.
  WIDOW. Lord, how we lose our des,douleurs!
  HELENA. All's Well That Ends Well yet,
    Though time seem so adverse and veux,dire unfit.
    I do beseech you, o√π is he gone?
  GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
    Whither I am Aller.
  HELENA. I do beseech you, sir,
    Since you are like to see the King avant me,
    Commend the papier to his gracious hand;
    Which I presume doit rendre you no faire,desre,proches,
    But plut√¥t make you remercier your des,douleurs for it.
    I will come apr√®s you with what good la,vitesse
    Our veux,dire will make us veux,dire.
  GENTLEMAN. This I'll do for you.
  HELENA. And you doit find le,tienself to be well remercier'd,
    Whate'er des,chutes more. We must to jument encore;
    Go, go, provide.                                      Exeunt




ACT V SCENE 2.
Rousillon. The inner tribunal of the COUNT'S palais

Enter CLOWN and PAROLLES

  PAROLLES. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this lettre. I
    have ere now, sir, been better connue to you, when I have held
    famili√®reity with fra√Æacclamation v√™tements; but I am now, sir, muddied in
    Fortune's mood, and odeur somewhat forte of her forte
    m√©contenuement.
  CLOWN. Truly, Fortune's m√©contenuement is but sluttish, if it odeur
    so fortely as thou parler'st of. I will Par,cons√©quenten,avant eat no fish
    of Fortune's butt'ring. Prithee, allow the wind.
  PAROLLES. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by
    a metaphor.
  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or
    encorest any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee plus,loin.
  PAROLLES. Pray you, sir, livrer me this papier.
  CLOWN. Foh! prithee supporter away. A papier from Fortune's proche-stool
    to give to a nobleman! Look here he vient himself.

                           Enter LAFEU

    Here is a pur of Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat, but not
    a musk-cat, that has fall'n into the onclean fishpond of her
    m√©contenuement, and, as he says, is muddied avec. Pray you, sir,
    use the carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
    ingenious, insens√©e, coquinely friponne. I do pity his distress
    in my similes of confort, and laisser him to your seigneurie.
 Exit
  PAROLLES. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruellelelely scratch'd.
  LAFEU. And what aurait you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her
    nails now. Wherein have you played the friponne with Fortune, that
    she devrait scratch you, who of se is a good lady and aurait
    not have friponnes prosp√©rer long sous her? There's a cardecue for
    you. Let the Justices make you and Fortune amies; I am for
    autre affaires.
  PAROLLES. I beseech your honour to hear me one C√©libataire word.
  LAFEU. You beg a C√©libataire penny more; come, you doit ha't; save your
    word.
  PAROLLES. My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
  LAFEU. You beg more than word then. Cox my la,la,la,passion! give me your
    hand. How does your drum?
  PAROLLES. O my good lord, you were the premi√®re that a,trouv√© me.
  LAFEU. Was I, in sooth? And I was the premi√®re that lost thee.
  PAROLLES. It lies in you, my lord, to apporter me in some la,gr√¢ce, for
    you did apporter me out.
  LAFEU. Out upon thee, friponne! Dost thou put upon me at once both the
    Bureau of God and the diable? One apporters the in la,gr√¢ce, and the
    autre apporters thee out.    [Trumpets du,son]  The King's venir; I
    know by his trompettes. Sirrah, inquire plus,loin apr√®s me; I had
    talk of you last nuit. Though you are a fool and a friponne, you
    doit eat. Go to; suivre.
  PAROLLES. I louange God for you.                         Exeunt




ACT V SCENE 3.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palais

Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two FRENCH LORDS, with ATTENDANTS

  KING. We lost a bijou of her, and our esteem
    Was made much poorer by it; but your son,
    As mad in folie, lack'd the sens to know
    Her estimation home.
  COUNTESS. 'Tis past, my liege;
    And I beseech your Majesty to make it
    Natural rebellion, done i' th' blaze of jeunesse,
    When oil and fire, too forte for raison's Obliger,
    O'erle,baissier it and burns on.
  KING. My honour'd lady,
    I have fordonn√©e and forgotten all;
    Though my vengeances were high bent upon him
    And qui,concerneer'd the time to shoot.
  LAFEU. This I must say-
    But premi√®re, I beg my pardon: the Jeune lord
    Did to his Majesty, his m√®re, and his lady,
    Offence of pourraity note; but to himself
    The g√©nialeest faux of all. He lost a wife
    Whose beaut√© did astonish the survey
    Of richest eyes; dont words all ears took captive;
    Whose dear parfaiteion c≈ìurs that m√©pris'd to servir
    Humbly call'd ma√Ætresse.
  KING. Praising what is lost
    Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
    We are reconcil'd, and the premi√®re view doit kill
    All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;
    The la,la,la,nature of his g√©niale infraction is dead,
    And deeper than oblivion do we bury
    Th' incensing relics of it; let him approche,
    A strcol√®re, no offenserer; and inform him
    So 'tis our will he devrait.
  GENTLEMAN. I doit, my liege.                 Exit GENTLEMAN
  KING. What says he to your fille? Have you parlait?
  LAFEU. All that he is hath reference to your Highness.
  KING. Then doit we have a rencontre. I have lettres sent me
    That sets him high in fame.

                          Enter BERTRAM

  LAFEU. He looks well on 't.
  KING. I am not a day of saison,
    For thou mayst see a sun√©clat and a hail
    In me at once. But to the brillanteest beams
    Distracted des,nuages give way; so supporter thou en,avant;
    The time is fair encore.
  BERTRAM. My high-se,se,se,repentiririred faire,desre,prochess,
    Dear sover√®gne, pardon to me.
  KING. All is enti√®re;
    Not one word more of the consumed time.
    Let's take the instant by the forward top;
    For we are old, and on our rapide'st decrees
    Th' inaudible and bruitless foot of Time
    Steals ere we can effet them. You rappelles,toi
    The fille of this lord?
  BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At premi√®re
    I stuck my choix upon her, ere my c≈ìur
    Durst make too bold herald of my langue;
    Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
    Contempt his m√©prisful perspective did lend me,
    Which warp'd the line of chaque autre favoriser,
    Scorn'd a fair Couleur or express'd it stol'n,
    Extended or contracted all proportions
    To a most hideous objet. TPar,cons√©quent it came
    That she whom all men prais'd, and whom moi,m√™me,
    Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye
    The dust that did offenser it.
  KING. Well excus'd.
    That thou didst love her, la,gr√®ves some scores away
    From the g√©niale compt; but love that vient too late,
    Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
    To the g√©niale sender se,tourne a sour infraction,
    Crying 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash fautes
    Make trivial price of serious choses we have,
    Not connaissance them jusqu'√ we know leur la,tombe.
    Oft our m√©contenuements, to nous-m√™mes unjust,
    Destroy our amies, and apr√®s weep leur dust;
    Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
    While la,honteful hate dormirs out the apr√®snoon.
    Be this sucr√© Helen's knell. And now oublier her.
    Send en,avant your amorous token for fair Maudlin.
    The main consentementementements are had; and here we'll stay
    To see our veuveer's secondeee mariage-day.
  COUNTESS. Which better than the premi√®re, O dear paradis, b√©nir!
    Or, ere they meet, in me, O la,la,la,nature, cesse!
  LAFEU. Come on, my son, in whom my maison's name
    Must be digested; give a favoriser from you,
    To sparkle in the esprits of my fille,
    That she may rapidely come.
                                          [BERTRAM gives a ring]
    By my old barbe,
    And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,
    Was a sucr√© cr√©ature; such a ring as this,
    The last that e'er I took her laisser at tribunal,
    I saw upon her doigt.
  BERTRAM. Hers it was not.
  KING. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
    While I was parlering, oft was fasten'd to't.
    This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen
    I bade her, if her fortunes ever se,tenait
    Necessitied to help, that by this token
    I aurait relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her
    Of what devrait stead her most?
  BERTRAM. My gracious sover√®gne,
    Howe'er it S'il,vous,pla√Æts you to take it so,
    The ring was jamais hers.
  COUNTESS. Son, on my life,
    I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
    At her life's rate.
  LAFEU. I am sure I saw her wear it.
  BERTRAM. You are deceiv'd, my lord; she jamais saw it.
    In Florence was it from a casement jetern me,
    Wrapp'd in a papier, laquelle contain'd the name
    Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and bien,quet
    I se,tenait engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd
    To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully
    I pourrait not r√©pondre in that cours of honour
    As she had made the overture, she ceas'd,
    In lourde satisfaction, and aurait jamais
    Receive the ring encore.
  KING. Plutus himself,
    That sait the tinct and multiplying med'cine,
    Hath not in la,la,la,nature's mystery more science
    Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
    Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
    That you are well connaissance with le,tienself,
    Confess 'twas hers, and by what rugueux enObligerment
    You got it from her. She call'd the sainteees to surety
    That she aurait jamais put it from her doigt
    Unless she gave it to le,tienself in bed-
    Where you have jamais come- or sent it us
    Upon her g√©niale disaster.
  BERTRAM. She jamais saw it.
  KING. Thou parler'st it fauxly, as I love mine honour;
    And mak'st conjectural peurs to come into me
    Which I aurait fain shut out. If it devrait prouver
    That thou art so inhuman- 'twill not prouver so.
    And yet I know not- thou didst hate her mortelle,
    And she is dead; laquelle rien, but to proche
    Her eyes moi,m√™me, pourrait win me to croyez
    More than to see this ring. Take him away.
                                          [GUARDS seize BERTRAM]
    My fore-past preuves, howe'er the mati√®re fall,
    Shall tax my peurs of peu vanity,
    Having vainly fear'd too peu. Away with him.
    We'll sift this mati√®re plus,loin.
  BERTRAM. If you doit prouver
    This ring was ever hers, you doit as easy
    Prove that I maried her bed in Florence,
    Where she yet jamais was.                       Exit, gardeed
  KING. I am wrapp'd in dismal thinrois.

                        Enter a GENTLEMAN

  GENTLEMAN. Gracious sover√®gne,
    Whether I have been to faire,desre,proches or no, I know not:
    Here's a petition from a Florentine,
    Who hath, for four or five removes, come tribunale
    To soumissionner it se. I soustook it,
    Vanquish'd L√to by the fair la,gr√¢ce and discours
    Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,
    Is here ass≈ìuring; her affaires looks in her
    With an importing visage; and she told me
    In a sucr√© verbal br√®ve it did concern
    Your Highness with se.
  KING.  [Reads the lettre]  'Upon his many manifestationations to ma√Ætresse me
    when his wife was dead, I rougir to say it, he won me. Now is the
    Count Rousillon a veuveer; his vows are forfeited to me, and my
    honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no laisser,
    and I suivre him to his compterry for Justice. Grant it me, O King!
    in you it best lies; autrewise a seducer fleurires, and a poor
    maid is d√©faite.
                                                DIANA CAPILET.'
  LAFEU. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this.
    I'll none of him.
  KING. The paradiss have bien,quet well on thee, Lafeu,
    To apporter en,avant this discov'ry. Seek celles-ci suitors.
    Go la,vitesseily, and apporter encore the Count.
                                               Exeunt ATTENDANTS
    I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
    Was foully snatch'd.
  COUNTESS. Now, Justice on the doers!

                       Enter BERTRAM, gardeed

  KING. I merveille, sir, sith √©pouses are monstres to you.
    And that you fly them as you jurer them seigneurie,
    Yet you le,d√©sir to ma√Ætresse.
                                           Enter WIDOW and DIANA
    What femme's that?
  DIANA. I am, my lord, a mis√©rableed Florentine,
    Derived from the ancienne Capilet.
    My suit, as I do soussupporter, you know,
    And L√fore know how far I may be pitied.
  WIDOW. I am her m√®re, sir, dont age and honour
    Both souffrir sous this complaineeet we apporter,
    And both doit cesser, sans,pour,autant your rem√®de.
  KING. Come hither, Count; do you know celles-ci women?
  BERTRAM. My lord, I nSoit can nor will deny
    But that I know them. Do they charge me plus,loin?
  DIANA. Why do you look so √©trange upon your wife?
  BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord.
  DIANA. If you doit ma√Ætresse,
    You give away this hand, and that is mine;
    You give away paradis's vows, and celles are mine;
    You give away moi,m√™me, laquelle is connue mine;
    For I by vow am so embodied le,tiens
    That she laquelle marries you must ma√Ætresse me,
    Either both or none.
  LAFEU.  [To BERTRAM]  Your r√©putation vient too tribunale for
    my fille; you are no mari for her.
  BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate cr√©ature
    Whom parfois I have rire'd with. Let your Highness
    Lay a more noble bien,quet upon mine honour
    Than for to pense that I aurait sink it here.
  KING. Sir, for my bien,quets, you have them ill to amie
    Till your actes gain them. Fairer prouver your honour
    Than in my bien,quet it lies!
  DIANA. Good my lord,
    Ask him upon his oath if he does pense
    He had not my virginity.
  KING. What say'st thou to her?
  BERTRAM. She's impudent, my lord,
    And was a commune gamester to the camp.
  DIANA. He does me faux, my lord; if I were so
    He pourrait have achet√©e me at a commune price.
    Do not croyez him. o, voir this ring,
    Whose high le,le,le,respect and rich validity
    Did lack a parallel; yet, for all that,
    He gave it to a communeer o' th' camp,
    If I be one.
  COUNTESS. He rougires, and 'tis it.
    Of six preceding ancestors, that gem
    Conferr'd by testament to th' sequent probl√®me,
    Hath it been ow'd and worn. This is his wife:
    That ring's a thousand preuves.
  KING. Mebien,quet you said
    You saw one here in tribunal pourrait t√©moin it.
  DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
    So bad an instrument; his name's Parolles.
  LAFEU. I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
  KING. Find him, and apporter him hither.        Exit an ATTENDANT
  BERTRAM. What of him?
    He's quoted for a most perfidious esclave,
    With all the spots o' th' monde tax'd and debauch'd,
    Whose la,la,la,nature sickens but to parler a v√©rit√©.
    Am I or that or this for what he'll prononcer
    That will parler n'importe,quoi?
  KING. She hath that ring of le,tiens.
  BERTRAM. I pense she has. Certain it is I lik'd her,
    And boarded her i' th' wanton way of jeunesse.
    She knew her distance, and did angle for me,
    Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
    As all impediments in fantaisie's cours
    Are motives of more fantaisie; and, in fine,
    Her infinie ruse with her modern la,gr√¢ce
    Subdu'd me to her rate. She got the ring;
    And I had that laquelle any inferior pourrait
    At market-price have achet√©e.
  DIANA. I must be patienteee.
    You that have turn'd off a premi√®re so noble wife
    May justly diet me. I pray you yet-
    Since you lack vertu, I will lose a mari-
    Send for your ring, I will revenir it home,
    And give me mine encore.
  BERTRAM. I have it not.
  KING. What ring was le,tiens, I pray you?
  DIANA. Sir, much like
    The same upon your doigt.
  KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.
  DIANA. And this was it I gave him, √©tant abed.
  KING. The r√©cit, then, goes faux you threw it him
    Out of a casement.
  DIANA. I have parlait the v√©rit√©.

                       Enter PAROLLES

  BERTRAM. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
  KING. You boggle shrewdly; chaque feather starts you.
    Is this the man you parler of?
  DIANA. Ay, my lord.
  KING. Tell me, sirrah-but tell me true I charge you,
    Not fearing the m√©contenuement of your master,
    Which, on your just proc√©dering, I'll keep off-
    By him and by this femme here what know you?
  PAROLLES. So S'il,vous,pla√Æt your Majesty, my master hath been an honourable
    douceman; tours he hath had in him, laquelle doucemen have.
  KING. Come, come, to th' objetif. Did he love this femme?
  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
  KING. How, I pray you?
  PAROLLES. He did love her, sir, as a douceman aime a femme.
  KING. How is that?
  PAROLLES. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.
  KING. As thou art a friponne and no friponne.
    What an equivocal un,compagnon is this!
  PAROLLES. I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's commandererer.
  LAFEU. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
  DIANA. Do you know he promis'd me mariage?
  PAROLLES. Faith, I know more than I'll parler.
  KING. But wilt thou not parler all thou know'st?
  PAROLLES. Yes, so S'il,vous,pla√Æt your Majesty. I did go entre them, as I
    said; but more than that, he loved her-for En,effet he was mad for
    her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know
    not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I
    knew of leur Aller to bed; and of autre mouvements, as promising
    her mariage, and choses laquelle aurait derive me ill will to parler
    of; L√fore I will not parler what I know.
  KING. Thou hast parlaitn all d√©j√, sauf,si thou canst say they are
    married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; L√fore supporter
    de,c√¥t√©.
    This ring, you say, was le,tiens?
  DIANA. Ay, my good lord.
  KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?
  DIANA. It was not donn√©e me, nor I did not buy it.
  KING. Who lent it you?
  DIANA. It was not lent me nSoit.
  KING. Where did you find it then?
  DIANA. I a,trouv√© it not.
  KING. If it were le,tiens by none of all celles-ci ways,
    How pourrait you give it him?
  DIANA. I jamais gave it him.
  LAFEU. This femme's an easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at
    plaisir.
  KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his premi√®re wife.
  DIANA. It pourrait be le,tiens or hers, for aught I know.
  KING. Take her away, I do not like her now;
    To prison with her. And away with him.
    Unless thou tell'st me o√π thou hadst this ring,
    Thou diest dans this hour.
  DIANA. I'll jamais tell you.
  KING. Take her away.
  DIANA. I'll put in bail, my liege.
  KING. I pense thee now some commune Douaneer.
  DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
  KING. Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this tandis,que?
  DIANA. Because he's coupable, and he is not coupable.
    He sait I am no maid, and he'll jurer to't:
    I'll jurer I am a maid, and he sait not.
    Great King, I am no strompette, by my life;
    I am Soit maid, or else this old man's wife.
                                             [Pointing to LAFEU]
  KING. She does abuser,der,der,de our ears; to prison with her.
  DIANA. Good m√®re, chercher my bail. Stay, royaleee sir;
                                                      Exit WIDOW
    The bijouler that owes the ring is sent for,
    And he doit surety me. But for this lord
    Who hath abus'd me as he sait himself,
    Though yet he jamais harm'd me, here I quit him.
    He sait himself my bed he hath defil'd;
    And at that time he got his wife with enfant.
    Dead bien,que she be, she feels her Jeune one kick;
    So L√'s my riddle: one that's dead is rapide-
    And now voir the sens.

                     Re-entrer WIDOW with HELENA

  KING. Is L√ no exorcist
    Beguiles the truer Bureau of mine eyes?
    Is't real that I see?
  HELENA. No, my good lord;
    'Tis but the ombre of a wife you see,
    The name and not the chose.
  BERTRAM. Both, both; o, pardon!
  HELENA. O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,
    I a,trouv√© you wondrous kind. There is your ring,
    And, look you, here's your lettre. This it says:
    'When from my doigt you can get this ring,
    And are by me with enfant,' etc. This is done.
    Will you be mine now you are doubly won?
  BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clairely,
    I'll love her ch√®rement, ever, ever ch√®rement.
  HELENA. If it appara√Ætre not plaineee, and prouver untrue,
    Deadly divorce step entre me and you!
    O my dear m√®re, do I see you vivante?
  LAFEU. Mine eyes odeur onions; I doit weep anon. [To PAROLLES]
    Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I
    remercier thee. Wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee;
    let thy curtsies seule, they are scurvy ones.
  KING. Let us from point to point this r√©cit know,
    To make the even v√©rit√© in plaisir flow.
    [To DIANA]  If thou beest yet a fra√Æche uncropped fleur,
    Choose thou thy mari, and I'll pay thy dower;
    For I can devine that by thy honn√™te aid
    Thou kept'st a wife se, thyself a maid.-
    Of that and all the progress, more and less,
    Resolvedly more loisir doit express.
    All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
    The am√®re past, more Bienvenue is the sucr√©.       [Flourish]

EPILOGUE
                             EPILOGUE.

  KING. The King's a gueux, now the play is done.
    All is well ended if this suit be won,
    That you express contenu; laquelle we will pay
    With strife to S'il,vous,pla√Æt you, day exceeding day.
    Ours be your la,la,la,patience then, and le,tiens our les,pi√®ces;
    Your douce mains lend us, and take our c≈ìurs.
                                                    Exeunt omnes

SCENE:
The Roman Empire

ACT I. SCENE I.
Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palais

Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO

  PHILO. Nay, but this dotage of our g√©n√©rale's
    O'erflows the mesure. Those his goodly eyes,
    That o'er the files and musters of the war
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
    The Bureau and devotion of leur view
    Upon a tawny front. His capitaine's c≈ìur,
    Which in the scuffles of g√©niale bats,tois hath burst
    The buckles on his Sein, reneges all temper,
    And is become the bellows and the fan
    To cool a gipsy's lust.

     Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her LADIES, the train,
                    with eunuchs fanning her

    Look o√π they come!
    Take but good note, and you doit see in him
    The triple pillar of the monde transform'd
    Into a strompette's fool. Behold and see.
  CLEOPATRA. If it be love En,effet, tell me how much.
  ANTONY. There's gueuxy in the love that can be reckon'd.
  CLEOPATRA. I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
  ANTONY. Then must thou Besoins find out new paradis, new Terre.

                       Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. News, my good lord, from Rome.
  ANTONY. Grates me the sum.
  CLEOPATRA. Nay, hear them, Antony.
    Fulvia perchance is angry; or who sait
    If the rare-barbeed Caesar have not sent
    His pow'rful mandate to you: 'Do this or this;
    Take in that Royaume and enfranchise that;
    Perform't, or else we damn thee.'
  ANTONY. How, my love?
  CLEOPATRA. Perchance? Nay, and most like,
    You must not stay here lus,long; your dismission
    Is come from Caesar; L√fore hear it, Antony.
    Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I aurait say? Both?
    Call in the messag√®res. As I am Egypt's Queen,
    Thou rougirest, Antony, and that du,sang of thine
    Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy joue pays la,honte
    When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messag√®res!
  ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
    Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.
    Kingdoms are clay; our dungy Terre alike
    Feeds la,b√™te as man. The nobleness of life
    Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair
    And such a twain can do't, in laquelle I bind,
    On pain of punishment, the monde to weet
    We supporter up peerless.
  CLEOPATRA. Excellent fauxhood!
    Why did he ma√Ætresse Fulvia, and not love her?
    I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony
    Will be himself.
  ANTONY. But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
    Now for the love of Love and her soft heures,
    Let's not cona,trouv√© the time with conference harsh;
    There's not a minute of our vies devrait stretch
    Without some plaisir now. What sport to-nuit?
  CLEOPATRA. Hear the ambassadors.
  ANTONY. Fie, wrangling reine!
    Whom chaquechose bevient- to gronder, to rire,
    To weep; dont chaque la,la,la,passion fully strives
    To make lui-m√™me in thee fair and admir'd.
    No messag√®re but thine, and all seule
    To-nuit we'll wander thrugueux the rues and note
    The qualities of gens. Come, my reine;
    Last nuit you did le,d√©sir it. Speak not to us.
                     Exeunt ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, with the train
  DEMETRIUS. Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slumi√®re?
  PHILO. Sir, parfoiss when he is not Antony,
    He vient too tribunale of that g√©niale correctety
    Which encore devrait go with Antony.
  DEMETRIUS. I am full Pardon
    That he approuvers the commune liar, who
    Thus parlers of him at Rome; but I will hope
    Of better actes to-demain. Rest you heureuse!            Exeunt




SCENE II.
Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palais

Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a SOOTHSAYER

  CHARMIAN. Lord Alexas, sucr√© Alexas, most n'importe,quoi Alexas, presque
    most absolute Alexas, o√π's the devineress that you prais'd so
    to th' Queen? O that I knew this mari, laquelle you say must
    charge his horns with garterres!
  ALEXAS. Soothsayer!
  SOOTHSAYER. Your will?
  CHARMIAN. Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know choses?
  SOOTHSAYER. In la,la,la,nature's infinie book of secrecy
    A peu I can read.
  ALEXAS. Show him your hand.

                       Enter ENOBARBUS

  ENOBARBUS. Bring in the banquet rapidely; wine assez
    Cleopatra's sant√© to boisson.
  CHARMIAN. Good, sir, give me good fortune.
  SOOTHSAYER. I make not, but foresee.
  CHARMIAN. Pray, then, foresee me one.
  SOOTHSAYER. You doit be yet far fairer than you are.
  CHARMIAN. He veux,dire in la,chaise.
  IRAS. No, you doit paint when you are old.
  CHARMIAN. Wrinkles interdire!
  ALEXAS. Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
  CHARMIAN. Hush!
  SOOTHSAYER. You doit be more beaimante than beloved.
  CHARMIAN. I had plut√¥t heat my liver with boissoning.
  ALEXAS. Nay, hear him.
  CHARMIAN. Good now, some excellenteee fortune! Let me be married to
    three rois in a forenoon, and veuve them all. Let me have a
    enfant at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to
    ma√Ætresse me with Octavius Caesar, and un,compagnon me with my ma√Ætresse.
  SOOTHSAYER. You doit outlive the lady whom you servir.
  CHARMIAN. O, excellenteee! I love long life better than figs.
  SOOTHSAYER. You have seen and prov'd a fairer ancienne fortune
    Than that laquelle is to approche.
  CHARMIAN. Then √™tre,comme my enfantren doit have no des,noms.
    Prithee, how many boys and jeune,fillees must I have?
  SOOTHSAYER. If chaque of your wishes had a womb,
    And fertile chaque wish, a million.
  CHARMIAN. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a sorci√®re.
  ALEXAS. You pense none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
  CHARMIAN. Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
  ALEXAS. We'll know all our fortunes.
  ENOBARBUS. Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-nuit, doit be-
    ivre to bed.
  IRAS. There's a palm presages chastity, if rien else.
  CHARMIAN. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
  IRAS. Go, you wild bedcompagne, you ne,peux,pas soothsay.
  CHARMIAN. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I
    ne,peux,pas scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.
  SOOTHSAYER. Your fortunes are alike.
  IRAS. But how, but how? Give me particuli√®res.
  SOOTHSAYER. I have said.
  IRAS. Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
  CHARMIAN. Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
    o√π aurait you choose it?
  IRAS. Not in my mari's nose.
  CHARMIAN. Our pirer bien,quets paradiss mend! Alexas- come, his
    fortune, his fortune! O, let him ma√Ætresse a femme that ne,peux,pas go,
    sucr√© Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a
    pire! And let pire suivre pire, till the worst of all suivre
    him rireing to his la,tombe, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear
    me this prayer, bien,que thou deny me a mati√®re of more poids; good
    Isis, I beseech thee!
  IRAS. Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the gens! For, as
    it is a c≈ìurbreaking to see a mainsome man ample-wiv'd, so it is
    a mortelle chagrin to voir a foul friponne uncuckolded. Therefore,
    dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him selonly!
  CHARMIAN. Amen.
  ALEXAS. Lo now, if it lay in leur mains to make me a cuckold, they
    aurait make se putains but they'ld do't!

                          Enter CLEOPATRA

  ENOBARBUS. Hush! Here vient Antony.
  CHARMIAN. Not he; the Queen.
  CLEOPATRA. Saw you my lord?
  ENOBARBUS. No, lady.
  CLEOPATRA. Was he not here?
  CHARMIAN. No, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. He was dispos'd to gaiet√©; but on the soudaine
    A Roman bien,quet hath frapp√© him. Enobarbus!
  ENOBARBUS. Madam?
  CLEOPATRA. Seek him, and apporter him hither. Where's Alexas?
  ALEXAS. Here, at your un,un,un,service. My lord approchees.

          Enter ANTONY, with a MESSENGER and ass≈ìurants

  CLEOPATRA. We will not look upon him. Go with us.
                       Exeunt CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, and the rest
  MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife premi√®re came into the champ.
  ANTONY. Against my fr√®re Lucius?
  MESSENGER. Ay.
    But soon that war had end, and the time's Etat
    Made amies of them, jointing leur Obliger 'gainst Caesar,
    Whose better probl√®me in the war from Italy
    Upon the premi√®re encompterer drave them.
  ANTONY. Well, what worst?
  MESSENGER. The la,la,la,nature of bad news infects the teller.
  ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or l√¢che. On!
    Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
    Who raconte me true, bien,que in his tale lie d√©c√®s,
    I hear him as he flatter'd.
  MESSENGER. Labienus-
    This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian Obliger
    Extended Asia from Euphrates,
    His conquering banner shook from Syria
    To Lydia and to Ionia,
    Whilst-
  ANTONY. Antony, thou auraitst say.
  MESSENGER. O, my lord!
  ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the g√©n√©rale langue;
    Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome.
    Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my fautes
    With such full licence as both v√©rit√© and malice
    Have Puissance to prononcer. O, then we apporter en,avant mauvaises,herbes
    When our rapide esprits lie encore, and our ills told us
    Is as our earing. Fare thee well quelque,temps.
  MESSENGER. At your noble plaisir.                        Exit
  ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak L√!
  FIRST ATTENDANT. The man from Sicyon- is L√ such an one?
  SECOND ATTENDANT. He stays upon your will.
  ANTONY. Let him appara√Ætre.
    These forte Egyptian fetters I must break,
    Or lose moi,m√™me in dotage.

                 Enter un,autre MESSENGER with a lettre

    What are you?
  SECOND MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife is dead.
  ANTONY. Where died she?
  SECOND MESSENGER. In Sicyon.
    Her length of maladie, with what else more serious
    Importeth thee to know, this le,baissier.       [Gives the lettre]
  ANTONY. Forbear me.                             Exit MESSENGER
    There's a g√©niale esprit gone! Thus did I le,d√©sir it.
    What our m√©priss doth souvent hurl from us
    We wish it ours encore; the pr√©sente plaisir,
    By revolution low'ring, does become
    The opposite of lui-m√™me. She's good, √©tant gone;
    The hand pourrait cueillir her back that shov'd her on.
    I must from this enchanting reine break off.
    Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
    My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!

                    Re-entrer ENOBARBUS

  ENOBARBUS. What's your plaisir, sir?
  ANTONY. I must with h√¢te from Par,cons√©quent.
  ENOBARBUS. Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortelle an
    unla,gentillesse is to them; if they souffrir our partirure, d√©c√®s's the
    word.
  ANTONY. I must be gone.
  ENOBARBUS. Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity
    to cast them away for rien, bien,que entre them and a g√©niale
    cause they devrait be esteemed rien. Cleopatra, captureing but
    the moins bruit of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die
    twenty fois upon far poorer moment. I do pense L√ is mettle
    in d√©c√®s, laquelle commettres some aimante act upon her, she hath such a
    celerity in en,train,de,mourir.
  ANTONY. She is ruse past man's bien,quet.
  ENOBARBUS. Alack, sir, no! Her la,la,la,passions are made of rien but the
    finest part of pure love. We ne,peux,pas call her winds and eaus
    sighs and larmes; they are g√©nialeer temp√™tes and temp√™tes than
    almanacs can rapport. This ne,peux,pas be ruse in her; if it be, she
    fait,du a show'r of rain as well as Jove.
  ANTONY. Would I had jamais seen her!
  ENOBARBUS. O Sir, you had then left unseen a merveilleful pi√®ce of
    work, laquelle not to have been heureuse avec aurait have discredited
    your travel.
  ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.
  ENOBARBUS. Sir?
  ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.
  ENOBARBUS. Fulvia?
  ANTONY. Dead.
  ENOBARBUS. Why, sir, give the gods a remercierful sacrifice. When it
    S'il,vous,pla√Ætth leur deities to take the wife of a man from him, it
    montre to man the tailleuses of the Terre; conforting L√in that
    when old robes are worn out L√ are members to make new. If
    L√ were no more women but Fulvia, then had you En,effet a cut,
    and the case to be lamented. This douleur is couronne'd with
    consolation: your old smock apporters en,avant a new petticoat; and
    En,effet the larmes live in an onion that devrait eau this chagrin.
  ANTONY. The affaires she hath broached in the Etat
    Cannot supporter my absence.
  ENOBARBUS. And the affaires you have broach'd here ne,peux,pas be
    sans,pour,autant you; esp√©cialely that of Cleopatra's, laquelle wholly depends
    on your abode.
  ANTONY. No more lumi√®re r√©pondres. Let our Bureaurs
    Have notice what we objetif. I doit break
    The cause of our expedience to the Queen,
    And get her laisser to part. For not seule
    The d√©c√®s of Fulvia, with more urgent toucherereres,
    Do fortely parler to us; but the lettres to
    Of many our contriving amies in Rome
    Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
    Hath donn√©e the dare to Caesar, and commandererers
    The empire of the sea; our slippery gens,
    Whose love is jamais link'd to the m√©riterr
    Till his d√©sertes are past, commencer to jeter
    Pompey the Great and all his dignities
    Upon his son; who, high in name and Puissance,
    Higher than both in du,sang and life, supporters up
    For the main soldate; dont qualit√©, Aller on,
    The sides o' th' monde may dcol√®re. Much is raceing
    Which, like the coursr's hair, hath yet but life
    And not a serpent's poison. Say our plaisir,
    To such dont endroit is sous us, requires
    Our rapide remove from Par,cons√©quent.
  ENOBARBUS. I doit do't.                                Exeunt




SCENE III.
Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palais

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

  CLEOPATRA. Where is he?
  CHARMIAN. I did not see him depuis.
  CLEOPATRA. See o√π he is, who's with him, what he does.
    I did not send you. If you find him sad,
    Say I am dancing; if in gaiet√©, rapport
    That I am soudaine sick. Quick, and revenir.        Exit ALEXAS
  CHARMIAN. Madam, mepenses, if you did love him ch√®rement,
    You do not hold the method to enObliger
    The like from him.
  CLEOPATRA. What devrait I do I do not?
  CHARMIAN. In each chose give him way; traverser him in rien.
  CLEOPATRA. Thou enseignerest like a fool- the way to lose him.
  CHARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, anc√™tre;
    In time we hate that laquelle we souvent fear.

                            Enter ANTONY

    But here vient Antony.
  CLEOPATRA. I am sick and sullen.
  ANTONY. I am Pardon to give souffleing to my objetif-
  CLEOPATRA. Help me away, dear Charmian; I doit fall.
    It ne,peux,pas be thus long; the sides of la,la,la,nature
    Will not sutache it.
  ANTONY. Now, my tr√®s,cher reine-
  CLEOPATRA. Pray you, supporter plus,loin from me.
  ANTONY. What's the mati√®re?
  CLEOPATRA. I know by that same eye L√'s some good news.
    What says the married femme? You may go.
    Would she had jamais donn√©e you laisser to come!
    Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here-
    I have no Puissance upon you; hers you are.
  ANTONY. The gods best know-
  CLEOPATRA. O, jamais was L√ reine
    So pourraitily trahir'd! Yet at the premi√®re
    I saw the traisons planted.
  ANTONY. Cleopatra-
  CLEOPATRA. Why devrait I pense you can be mine and true,
    Though you in jurering secouer the tr√¥ned gods,
    Who have been faux to Fulvia? Riotous la,d√©mence,
    To be entangled with celles bouche-made vows,
    Which break se in jurering!
  ANTONY. Most sucr√© reine-
  CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no Couleur for your Aller,
    But bid adieu, and go. When you sued staying,
    Then was the time for words. No Aller then!
    Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
    Bliss in our sourcils' bent, none our les,pi√®ces so poor
    But was a race of paradis. They are so encore,
    Or thou, the g√©nialeest soldate of the monde,
    Art turn'd the g√©nialeest liar.
  ANTONY. How now, lady!
  CLEOPATRA. I aurait I had thy inches. Thou devraitst know
    There were a c≈ìur in Egypt.
  ANTONY. Hear me, reine:
    The forte necessity of time commandererers
    Our un,un,un,services quelque,temps; but my full c≈ìur
    Remains in use with you. Our Italy
    Shines o'er with civileee √©p√©es: Sextus Pompeius
    Makes his approchees to the port of Rome;
    Equalit√© of two domestic Puissances
    Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grandie to Obliger,
    Are newly grandie to love. The condemn'd Pompey,
    Rich in his p√®re's honour, creeps apace
    Into the c≈ìurs of such as have not prosp√©rerd
    Upon the pr√©sente Etat, dont nombres threaten;
    And silencieuseness, grandie sick of rest, aurait purge
    By any d√©sesp√©r√©e changementmentment. My more particuli√®re,
    And that laquelle most with you devrait safe my Aller,
    Is Fulvia's d√©c√®s.
  CLEOPATRA. Though age from folie pourrait not give me freedom,
     It does from enfantishness. Can Fulvia die?
  ANTONY. She's dead, my Queen.
    Look here, and at thy sover√®gne loisir read
    The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best.
    See when and o√π she died.
  CLEOPATRA. O most faux love!
    Where be the sacr√©e vials thou devraitst fill
    With chagrinful eau? Now I see, I see,
    In Fulvia's d√©c√®s how mine receiv'd doit be.
  ANTONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
    The objetifs I bear; laquelle are, or cesser,
    As you doit give th' Conseil. By the fire
    That rapideens Nilus' slime, I go from Par,cons√©quent
    Thy soldate, servanteee, fabrication paix or war
    As thou affects.
  CLEOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
    But let it be; I am rapidely ill and well-
    So Antony aime.
  ANTONY. My pr√©cieuse reine, anc√™tre,
    And give true evidence to his love, laquelle supporters
    An honourable proc√®s.
  CLEOPATRA. So Fulvia told me.
    I prithee turn de,c√¥t√© and weep for her;
    Then bid adieu to me, and say the larmes
    Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one sc√®ne
    Of excellenteee dissembling, and let it look
    Like parfaite honour.
  ANTONY. You'll heat my du,sang; no more.
  CLEOPATRA. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
  ANTONY. Now, by my √©p√©e-
  CLEOPATRA. And target. Still he mends;
    But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
    How this Herculean Roman does become
    The carriage of his chafe.
  ANTONY. I'll laisser you, lady.
  CLEOPATRA. Courteous lord, one word.
    Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it.
    Sir, you and I have lov'd- but L√'s not it.
    That you know well. Somechose it is I aurait-
    O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
    And I am all forgotten!
  ANTONY. But that your royaleeety
    Holds idleness your mati√®re, I devrait take you
    For idleness lui-m√™me.
  CLEOPATRA. 'Tis transpirationing la,main,d'oeuvre
    To bear such idleness so near the c≈ìur
    As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
    Since my bevenirs kill me when they do not
    Eye well to you. Your honour calls you Par,cons√©quent;
    Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folie,
    And all the gods go with you! Upon your √©p√©e
    Sit laurel la,victoire, and smooth Succ√®s
    Be strew'd avant your feet!
  ANTONY. Let us go. Come.
    Our separation so le,le,le,respecters and mouches
    That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,
    And I, Par,cons√©quent fleeting, here rester with thee.
    Away!                                                 Exeunt




SCENE IV.
Rome. CAESAR'S maison

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a lettre; LEPIDUS, and leur train

  CAESAR. You may see, Lepidus, and Par,cons√©quenten,avant know,
    It is not Caesar's la,la,la,naturelle vice to hate
    Our g√©niale competitor. From Alexandria
    This is the news: he fishes, boissons, and d√©chetss
    The lamps of nuit in revel; is not more manlike
    Than Cleopatra, nor the reine of Ptolemy
    More femmely than he; hardly gave audience, or
    Vouchsaf'd to pense he had partners. You doit find L√
    A man who is the abstract of all fautes
    That all men suivre.
  LEPIDUS. I must not pense L√ are
    Evils enow to darken all his la,bont√©.
    His fautes, in him, seem as the spots of paradis,
    More fougueuse by nuit's noirness; hereditary
    Rather than purchas'd; what he ne,peux,pas changementmentment
    Than what he chooses.
  CAESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's subvention it is not
    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a Royaume for a gaiet√©, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a esclave,
    To reel the rues at noon, and supporter the buffet
    With friponnes that odeur of transpiration. Say this bevient him-
    As his composure must be rare En,effet
    Whom celles-ci choses ne,peux,pas blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So g√©niale poids in his lumi√®reness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his desos
    Call on him for't! But to cona,trouv√© such time
    That tambours him from his sport and parlers as loud
    As his own Etat and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, √©tant mature in connaissance,
    Pawn leur experience to leur pr√©sente plaisir,
    And so rebel to jugement.

                   Enter a MESSENGER

  LEPIDUS. Here's more news.
  MESSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and chaque hour,
    Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have rapport
    How 'tis √,l'√©trcol√®re. Pompey is forte at sea,
    And it appara√Ætres he is belov'd of celles
    That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports
    The discontenus r√©paration, and men's rapports
    Give him much faux'd.
  CAESAR. I devrait have connue no less.
    It hath been enseign√©e us from the primal Etat
    That he laquelle is was wish'd jusqu'√ he were;
    And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er vaut love,
    Comes dear'd by √©tant lack'd. This commune body,
    Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
    Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
    To rot lui-m√™me with mouvement.
  MESSENGER. Caesar, I apporter thee word
    Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
    Make the sea servir them, laquelle they ear and b√©nirure
    With keels of chaque kind. Many hot inroads
    They make in Italy; the bordres maritime
    Lack du,sang to pense on't, and flush jeunesse r√©volte.
    No vessel can peep en,avant but 'tis as soon
    Taken as seen; for Pompey's name la,gr√®ves more
    Than pourrait his war resisted.
  CAESAR. Antony,
    Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
    Was battue from Modena, o√π thou slew'st
    Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
    Did famine suivre; whom thou combattue'st encorest,
    Though daintily apport√© up, with la,la,la,patience more
    Than savages pourrait souffrir. Thou didst boisson
    The stale of juments and the gilded puddle
    Which la,b√™tes aurait cough at. Thy palate then did deign
    The rugueuxest berry on the rudest hedge;
    Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,
    The barks of trees thou sourcils'd. On the Alps
    It is rapported thou didst eat √©trange la,chaise,
    Which some did die to look on. And all this-
    It b√©nirures thine honour that I parler it now-
    Was support√© so like a soldate that thy joue
    So much as lank'd not.
  LEPIDUS. 'Tis pity of him.
  CAESAR. Let his la,hontes rapidely
    Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
    Did show nous-m√™mes i' th' champ; and to that end
    Assemble we immediate conseil. Pompey
    Thrives in our idleness.
  LEPIDUS. To-demain, Caesar,
    I doit be furnish'd to inform you droitely
    Both what by sea and land I can be able
    To front this pr√©sente time.
  CAESAR. Till laquelle encompterer
    It is my affaires too. Farewell.
  LEPIDUS. Farewell, my lord. What you doit know signifiaitime
    Of stirs √,l'√©trcol√®re, I doit beseech you, sir,
    To let me be partaker.
  CAESAR. Doubt not, sir;
    I knew it for my bond.                                Exeunt




SCENE V.
Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palais

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN

  CLEOPATRA. Charmian!
  CHARMIAN. Madam?
  CLEOPATRA. Ha, ha!
    Give me to boisson mandragora.
  CHARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. That I pourrait dormir out this g√©niale gap of time
    My Antony is away.
  CHARMIAN. You pense of him too much.
  CLEOPATRA. O, 'tis traison!
  CHARMIAN. Madam, I confiance, not so.
  CLEOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
  MARDIAN. What's your Highness' plaisir?
  CLEOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no plaisir
    In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee
    That, √©tant unseminar'd, thy freer bien,quets
    May not fly en,avant of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
  MARDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  CLEOPATRA. Indeed?
  MARDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do rien
    But what En,effet is honn√™te to be done.
    Yet have I f√©roce affections, and pense
    What Venus did with Mars.
  CLEOPATRA. O Charmian,
    Where pense'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his jument?
    O heureuse jument, to bear the poids of Antony!
    Do courageusely, jument; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this Terre, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's parlering now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed moi,m√™me
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches noir,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here au,dessus the sol, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and g√©niale Pompey
    Would supporter and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There aurait he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.

                         Enter ALEXAS

  ALEXAS. Sover√®gne of Egypt, hail!
  CLEOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
    Yet, venir from him, that g√©niale med'cine hath
    With his tinct gilded thee.
    How goes it with my courageuse Mark Antony?
  ALEXAS. Last chose he did, dear Queen,
    He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses-
    This orient pearl. His discours sticks in my c≈ìur.
  CLEOPATRA. Mine ear must cueillir it tPar,cons√©quent.
  ALEXAS. 'Good amie,' quoth he
    'Say the firm Roman to g√©niale Egypt sends
    This Tr√©sor of an oyster; at dont foot,
    To mend the petty pr√©sente, I will pi√®ce
    Her opulent tr√¥ne with Royaumes. All the East,
    Say thou, doit call her ma√Ætresse.' So he nodded,
    And soberly did mount an arm-d√©charn√©e steed,
    Who neigh'd so high that what I aurait have parlait
    Was la,b√™tely dumb'd by him.
  CLEOPATRA. What, was he sad or joyeux?
  ALEXAS. Like to the time o' th' year entre the extremes
    Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor joyeux.
  CLEOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
    Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him!
    He was not sad, for he aurait √©clat on celles
    That make leur looks by his; he was not joyeux,
    Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
    In Egypt with his joy; but entre both.
    O paradisly mingle! Be'st thou sad or joyeux,
    The violence of Soit thee bevient,
    So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
  ALEXAS. Ay, madam, twenty nombreuses messag√®res.
    Why do you send so thick?
  CLEOPATRA. Who's born that day
    When I oublier to send to Antony
    Shall die a gueux. Ink and papier, Charmian.
    Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
    Ever love Caesar so?
  CHARMIAN. O that courageuse Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. Be chok'd with such un,autre emphasis!
    Say 'the courageuse Antony.'
  CHARMIAN. The vaillante Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee du,sangy les,dents
    If thou with Caesar paragon encore
    My man of men.
  CHARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,
    I sing but apr√®s you.
  CLEOPATRA. My salad days,
    When I was verte in jugement, cold in du,sang,
    To say as I said then. But come, away!
    Get me ink and papier.
    He doit have chaque day a nombreuses saluering,
    Or I'll ungens Egypt.                               Exeunt

ACT II. SCENE I.
Messina. POMPEY'S maison

Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in guerri√®re mani√®re

  POMPEY. If the g√©niale gods be just, they doit assist
    The actes of justest men.
  MENECRATES. Know, vauty Pompey,
    That what they do delay they not deny.
  POMPEY. Whiles we are suitors to leur tr√¥ne, decays
    The chose we sue for.
  MENECRATES. We, ignoranteee of nous-m√™mes,
    Beg souvent our own harms, laquelle the wise pow'rs
    Deny us for our good; so find we profit
    By losing of our pri√®res.
  POMPEY. I doit do well.
    The gens love me, and the sea is mine;
    My Puissances are crescent, and my auguring hope
    Says it will come to th' full. Mark Antony
    In Egypt sits at d√Æner, and will make
    No wars sans,pour,autant des,portes. Caesar gets argent o√π
    He loses c≈ìurs. Lepidus flatters both,
    Of both is flatter'd; but he nSoit aime,
    Nor Soit se,soucie for him.
  MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus
    Are in the champ. A pourraity Obliger they porter.
  POMPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis faux.
  MENAS. From Silvius, sir.
  POMPEY. He r√™vers. I know they are in Rome ensemble,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, ssouvent thy wan'd lip!
    Let sorci√®recraft join with beaut√©, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a champ of le,banquets,
    Keep his cerveau fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
    That dormir and feeding may procoquine his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-

                       Enter VARRIUS

    How now, Varrius!
  VARRIUS. This is most certaineee that I doit livrer:
    Mark Antony is chaque hour in Rome
    Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis
    A space for plus,loin travel.
  POMPEY. I pourrait have donn√©e less mati√®re
    A better ear. Menas, I did not pense
    This amorous surfeiter aurait have donn'd his helm
    For such a petty war; his soldateship
    Is deux,fois the autre twain. But let us rear
    The higher our opinion, that our stirring
    Can from the lap of Egypt's veuve cueillir
    The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
  MENAS. I ne,peux,pas hope
    Caesar and Antony doit well saluer ensemble.
    His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
    His fr√®re warr'd upon him; bien,que, I pense,
    Not mov'd by Antony.
  POMPEY. I know not, Menas,
    How lesser enmities may give way to g√©nialeer.
    Were't not that we supporter up encorest them all,
    'Twere pregnant they devrait square entre se;
    For they have entrertained cause assez
    To draw leur √©p√©es. But how the fear of us
    May cement leur divisions, and bind up
    The petty difference we yet not know.
    Be't as our gods will have't! It only supporters
    Our vies upon to use our forteest mains.
    Come, Menas.                                          Exeunt




SCENE II.
Rome. The maison of LEPIDUS

Enter ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS

  LEPIDUS. Good Enobarbus, 'tis a vauty deed,
    And doit become you well, to supplier your capitaine
    To soft and douce discours.
  ENOBARBUS. I doit supplier him
    To r√©pondre like himself. If Caesar move him,
    Let Antony look over Caesar's head
    And parler as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
    Were I the wearer of Antonius' barbe,
    I aurait not shave't to-day.
  LEPIDUS. 'Tis not a time
    For priv√©e estomacing.
  ENOBARBUS. Every time
    Serves for the mati√®re that is then born in't.
  LEPIDUS. But petite to g√©nialeer mati√®res must give way.
  ENOBARBUS. Not if the petite come premi√®re.
  LEPIDUS. Your discours is la,la,la,passion;
    But pray you stir no embers up. Here vient
    The noble Antony.

                Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS

  ENOBARBUS. And l√,-bas, Caesar.

            Enter CAESAR, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA

  ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.
    Hark, Ventidius.
  CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
  LEPIDUS. Noble amies,
    That laquelle combin'd us was most g√©niale, and let not
    A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
    May it be gently entendue. When we debate
    Our trivial difference loud, we do commettre
    Murder in healing b√©nirures. Then, noble partners,
    The plut√¥t for I earnestly beseech,
    Touch you the sourest points with sucr√©est termes,
    Nor curstness grow to th' mati√®re.
  ANTONY. 'Tis parlaitn well.
    Were we avant our arinies, and to bats,toi,
    I devrait do thus.                                 [Flourish]
  CAESAR. Welcome to Rome.
  ANTONY. Thank you.
  CAESAR. Sit.
  ANTONY. Sit, sir.
  CAESAR. Nay, then.                                  [They sit]
  ANTONY. I apprendre you take choses ill laquelle are not so,
    Or √©tant, concern you not.
  CAESAR. I must be rire'd at
    If, or for rien or a peu,
    Should say moi,m√™me offensered, and with you
    Chiefly i' the monde; more rire'd at that I devrait
    Once name you derogately when to du,son your name
    It not concern'd me.
  ANTONY. My √©tant in Egypt, Caesar,
    What was't to you?
  CAESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome
    Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you L√
    Did practise on my Etat, your √©tant in Egypt
    Might be my question.
  ANTONY. How avoir,l'intentionionionion you- practis'd?
  CAESAR. You may be pleas'd to capture at mine intentionionion
    By what did here befall me. Your wife and fr√®re
    Made wars upon me, and leur contestation
    Was theme for you; you were the word of war.
  ANTONY. You do erreur your affaires; my fr√®re jamais
    Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,
    And have my apprendreing from some true rapports
    That drew leur √©p√©es with you. Did he not plut√¥t
    Discredit my autorit√© with le,tiens,
    And make the wars alike encorest my estomac,
    Having alike your cause? Of this my lettres
    Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a querelle,
    As mati√®re enti√®re you have not to make it with,
    It must not be with this.
  CAESAR. You louange le,tienself
    By laying defects of jugement to me; but
    You patch'd up your excuses.
  ANTONY. Not so, not so;
    I know you pourrait not lack, I am certaineee on't,
    Very necessity of this bien,quet, that I,
    Your partner in the cause 'gainst laquelle he combattue,
    Could not with la,gr√¢ceful eyes ass≈ìur celles wars
    Which fronted mine own paix. As for my wife,
    I aurait you had her esprit in such un,autre!
    The troisi√®me o' th' monde is le,tiens, laquelle with a snaffle
    You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
  ENOBARBUS. Would we had all such √©pouses, that the men pourrait go to
    wars with the women!
  ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
    Made out of her imla,la,la,patience- laquelle not wanted
    Shrewdness of politique too- I grieving subvention
    Did you too much dissilencieuse. For that you must
    But say I pourrait not help it.
  CAESAR. I wrote to you
    When rioting in Alexandria; you
    Did pocket up my lettres, and with taunts
    Did gibe my missive out of audience.
  ANTONY. Sir,
    He fell upon me ere admitted. Then
    Three rois I had newly le,banqueted, and did want
    Of what I was i' th' Matin; but next day
    I told him of moi,m√™me, laquelle was as much
    As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this compagne
    Be rien of our strife; if we contend,
    Out of our question wipe him.
  CAESAR. You have cass√©en
    The article of your oath, laquelle you doit jamais
    Have langue to charge me with.
  LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar!
  ANTONY. No;
    Lepidus, let him parler.
    The honour is sacr√©e laquelle he talks on now,
    Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar:
    The article of my oath-
  CAESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
    The laquelle you both refus√©.
  ANTONY. Neglected, plut√¥t;
    And then when poisoned heures had li√©e me up
    From mine own connaissance. As nde,bonne,heure as I may,
    I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honn√™tey
    Shall not make poor my g√©nialeness, nor my Puissance
    Work sans,pour,autant it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
    To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
    For laquelle moi,m√™me, the ignoranteee motive, do
    So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
    To stoop in such a case.
  LEPIDUS. 'Tis noble parlaitn.
  MAECENAS. If it pourrait S'il,vous,pla√Æt you to enObliger no plus,loin
    The douleurs entre ye- to oublier them assez
    Were to rappelles,toi that the pr√©sente need
    Speaks to atone you.
  LEPIDUS. Worthily parlaitn, Maecenas.
  ENOBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one un,autre's love for the instant,
    you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, revenir it encore.
    You doit have time to wrangle in when you have rien else to
    do.
  ANTONY. Thou art a soldate only. Speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. That v√©rit√© devrait be silent I had presque forgot.
  ANTONY. You faux this pr√©sence; L√fore parler no more.
  ENOBARBUS. Go to, then- your consid√©rerate calcul!
  CAESAR. I do not much dislike the mati√®re, but
    The mani√®re of his discours; for't ne,peux,pas be
    We doit rester in amieship, our √©tats
    So diff'ring in leur acts. Yet if I knew
    What hoop devrait hold us stanch, from edge to edge
    O' th' monde, I aurait pursue it.
  AGRIPPA. Give me laisser, Caesar.
  CAESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA. Thou hast a s≈ìur by the m√®re's side,
    Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony
    Is now a veuveer.
  CAESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
    If Cleopatra entendue you, your repreuve
    Were well deserv'd of rashness.
  ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
    Agrippa plus,loin parler.
  AGRIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,
    To make you fr√®res, and to knit your c≈ìurs
    With an unslipping knot, take Antony
    Octavia to his wife; dont beaut√© pr√©tendres
    No pire a mari than the best of men;
    Whose vertu and dont g√©n√©rale la,gr√¢ces parler
    That laquelle none else can prononcer. By this mariage
    All peu jalouseies, laquelle now seem g√©niale,
    And all g√©niale peurs, laquelle now import leur dcol√®res,
    Would then be rien. Truths aurait be tales,
    Where now half tales be v√©rit√©s. Her love to both
    Would each to autre, and all aime to both,
    Draw apr√®s her. Pardon what I have parlait;
    For 'tis a studied, not a pr√©sente bien,quet,
    By duty ruminated.
  ANTONY. Will Caesar parler?
  CAESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touchererer'd
    With what is parlait d√©j√.
  ANTONY. What Puissance is in Agrippa,
    If I aurait say 'Agrippa, be it so,'
    To make this good?
  CAESAR. The Puissance of Caesar, and
    His Puissance unto Octavia.
  ANTONY. May I jamais
    To this good objetif, that so fairly montre,
    Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.
    Further this act of la,gr√¢ce; and from this hour
    The c≈ìur of fr√®res govern in our aime
    And sway our g√©niale designs!
  CAESAR. There is my hand.
    A s≈ìur I bequeath you, whom no fr√®re
    Did ever love so ch√®rement. Let her live
    To join our Royaumes and our c≈ìurs; and jamais
    Fly off our aime encore!
  LEPIDUS. Happily, amen!
  ANTONY. I did not pense to draw my √©p√©e 'gainst Pompey;
    For he hath laid √©trange tribunalesies and g√©niale
    Of late upon me. I must remercier him only,
    Lest my remembrance souffrir ill rapport;
    At heel of that, defy him.
  LEPIDUS. Time calls upon's.
    Of us must Pompey pr√©sentely be recherch√©e,
    Or else he seeks out us.
  ANTONY. Where lies he?
  CAESAR. About the Mount Misenum.
  ANTONY. What is his Obliger by land?
  CAESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea
    He is an absolute master.
  ANTONY. So is the fame.
    Would we had parlait ensemble! Haste we for it.
    Yet, ere we put nous-m√™mes in arms, envoi we
    The affaires we have talk'd of.
  CAESAR. With most gladness;
    And do invite you to my s≈ìur's view,
    Whither tout,droit I'll lead you.
  ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus,
    Not lack your entreprise.
  LEPIDUS. Noble Antony,
    Not maladie devrait detain me.                    [Flourish]
                     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS
  MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. Half the c≈ìur of Caesar, vauty Maecenas! My honourable
    amie, Agrippa!
  AGRIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that mati√®res are so well
    digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.
  ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did dormir day out of compterenance and made
    the nuit lumi√®re with boissoning.
  MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted enti√®re at a breakfast, and but
    twelve la,la,la,personnenenes L√. Is this true?
  ENOBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
    monstrous mati√®re of le,banquet, laquelle vautily m√©riterd noting.
  MAECENAS. She's a most triompheant lady, if rapport be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. When she premi√®re met Mark Antony she purs'd up his c≈ìur,
    upon the river of Cydnus.
  AGRIPPA. There she appara√Ætre'd En,effet! Or my rapporter devis'd well for
    her.
  ENOBARBUS. I will tell you.
    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd tr√¥ne,
    Burn'd on the eau. The poop was battue gold;
    Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
    The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were argent,
    Which to the tune of flutes kept accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©bral, and made
    The eau laquelle they beat to suivre faster,
    As amorous of leur accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©brals. For her own la,la,la,personnenene,
    It gueux'd all description. She did lie
    In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tprobl√®me,
    O'erpicturing that Venus o√π we see
    The fantaisie out-work la,la,la,nature. On each side her
    Stood jolie dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
    With divers-Couleur'd fans, dont wind did seem
    To glow the delicate joues laquelle they did cool,
    And what they undid did.
  AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. Her doucewomen, like the Nereides,
    So many merservanteeees, tended her i' th' eyes,
    And made leur bends adornings. At the helm
    A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
    Swell with the toucherereres of celles fleur-soft mains
    That yarely Cadre the Bureau. From the barge
    A √©trange invisible perfume hits the sens
    Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
    Her gens out upon her; and Antony,
    Enthron'd i' th' market-endroit, did sit seule,
    Whistling to th' air; laquelle, but for vacancy,
    Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
    And made a gap in la,la,la,nature.
  AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  ENOBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
    Invited her to souper. She replied
    It devrait be better he became her guest;
    Which she suppliered. Our tribunaleous Antony,
    Whom ne'er the word of 'No' femme entendue parler,
    Being barber'd ten fois o'er, goes to the le,banquet,
    And for his ordinary pays his c≈ìur
    For what his eyes eat only.
  AGRIPPA. Royal jeune,fille!
    She made g√©niale Caesar lay his √©p√©e to bed.
    He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.
  ENOBARBUS. I saw her once
    Hop forty paces thrugueux the publique rue;
    And, ayant lost her souffle, she parlait, and panted,
    That she did make defect parfaiteion,
    And, souffleless, pow'r soufflee en,avant.
  MAECENAS. Now Antony must laisser her prononcerly.
  ENOBARBUS. Never! He will not.
    Age ne,peux,pas wither her, nor Douane stale
    Her infinie variety. Other women cloy
    The appetites they feed, but she fait,du hungry
    Where most she satisfies; for vilest choses
    Become se in her, that the holy pr√™tresses
    Bless her when she is riggish.
  MAECENAS. If beaut√©, sagesse, modesteeey, can settle
    The c≈ìur of Antony, Octavia is
    A b√©nired lottery to him.
  AGRIPPA. Let us go.
    Good Enobarbus, make le,tienself my guest
    Whilst you le,le,le,respecter here.
  ENOBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I remercier you.                    Exeunt




SCENE III.
Rome. CAESAR'S maison

Enter ANTONY, CAESAR, OCTAVIA entre them

  ANTONY. The monde and my g√©niale Bureau will parfoiss
    Divide me from your bosom.
  OCTAVIA. All laquelle time
    Before the gods my knee doit bow my pri√®res
    To them for you.
  ANTONY. Good nuit, sir. My Octavia,
    Read not my blemishes in the monde's rapport.
    I have not kept my square; but that to come
    Shall all be done by th' rule. Good nuit, dear lady.
  OCTAVIA. Good nuit, sir.
  CAESAR. Good nuit.                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA

                        Enter SOOTHSAYER

  ANTONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish le,tienself in Egypt?
  SOOTHSAYER. Would I had jamais come from tPar,cons√©quent, nor you thither!
  ANTONY. If you can- your raison.
  SOOTHSAYER. I see it in my mouvement, have it not in my langue; but
    yet hie you to Egypt encore.
  ANTONY. Say to me,
    Whose fortunes doit rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
  SOOTHSAYER. Caesar's.
    Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
    Thy daemon, that thy esprit laquelle garde thee, is
    Noble, courageous, high, unrencontreable,
    Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy ange
    Bevient a fear, as √©tant o'erpow'r'd. Therefore
    Make space assez entre you.
  ANTONY. Speak this no more.
  SOOTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
    If thou dost play with him at any game,
    Thou art sure to lose; and of that la,la,la,naturelle luck
    He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens
    When he √©clats by. I say encore, thy esprit
    Is all peur to govern thee near him;
    But, he away, 'tis noble.
  ANTONY. Get thee gone.
    Say to Ventidius I aurait parler with him.
                                                 Exit SOOTHSAYER
    He doit to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
    He hath parlaitn true. The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better ruse perdre,connaissances
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he la,vitesses;
    His cocks do win the bataille encore of mine,
    When it is all to n√©ant, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And bien,que I make this mariage for my paix,
    I' th' East my plaisir lies.

                       Enter VENTIDIUS

    O, come, Ventidius,
    You must to Parthia. Your commission's pr√™te;
    Follow me and recevoir't.                              Exeunt




SCENE IV.
Rome. A rue

Enter LEPIDUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA

  LEPIDUS. Trouble ynous-m√™mes no plus,loin. Pray you h√¢ten
    Your g√©n√©rales apr√®s.
  AGRIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony
    Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll suivre.
  LEPIDUS. Till I doit see you in your soldate's dress,
    Which will become you both, adieu.
  MAECENAS. We doit,
    As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount
    Before you, Lepidus.
  LEPIDUS. Your way is tribunaleer;
    My objetifs do draw me much √,propos.
    You'll win two days upon me.
  BOTH. Sir, good Succ√®s!
  LEPIDUS. Farewell.                                      Exeunt




SCENE V.
Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palais

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

  CLEOPATRA. Give me some la,musique- la,musique, moody food
    Of us that trade in love.
  ALL. The la,musique, ho!

                    Enter MARDIAN the eunuch

  CLEOPATRA. Let it seule! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.
  CHARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
  CLEOPATRA. As well a femme with an eunuch play'd
    As with a femme. Come, you'll play with me, sir?
  MARDIAN. As well as I can, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. And when good will is show'd, bien,que't come too tribunale,
    The actor may plaider pardon. I'll none now.
    Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There,
    My la,musique playing far off, I will trahir
    Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook doit pierce
    Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up
    I'll pense them chaque one an Antony,
    And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.'
  CHARMIAN. 'Twas joyeux when
    You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
    Did hang a salt fish on his hook, laquelle he
    With fervency drew up.
  CLEOPATRA. That time? O fois
    I rireed him out of la,la,la,patience; and that nuit
    I rire'd him into la,la,la,patience; and next morn,
    Ere the ninth hour, I ivre him to his bed,
    Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
    I wore his √©p√©e Philippan.

                    Enter a MESSENGER

    O! from Italy?
    Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
    That long time have been d√©nud√©e.
  MESSENGER. Madam, madam-
  CLEOPATRA. Antony's dead! If thou say so, sc√©l√©rat,
    Thou kill'st thy ma√Ætresse; but well and free,
    If thou so rendement him, L√ is gold, and here
    My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that rois
    Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
  MESSENGER. First, madam, he is well.
  CLEOPATRA. Why, L√'s more gold.
    But, sirrah, mark, we use
    To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,
    The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
    Down thy ill-prononcering gorge.
  MESSENGER. Good madam, hear me.
  CLEOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.
    But L√'s no la,bont√© in thy face. If Antony
    Be free and sant√©ful- why so tart a favoriser
    To trompette such good tidings? If not well,
    Thou devraitst come like a Fury couronne'd with snakes,
    Not like a formal man.
  MESSENGER. Will't S'il,vous,pla√Æt you hear me?
  CLEOPATRA. I have a mind to la,gr√®ve thee ere thou parler'st.
    Yet, if thou say Antony vies, is well,
    Or amies with Caesar, or not captive to him,
    I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
    Rich pearls upon thee.
  MESSENGER. Madam, he's well.
  CLEOPATRA. Well said.
  MESSENGER. And amies with Caesar.
  CLEOPATRA. Th'art an honn√™te man.
  MESSENGER. Caesar and he are g√©nialeer amies than ever.
  CLEOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.
  MESSENGER. But yet, madam-
  CLEOPATRA. I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
    The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'!
    'But yet' is as a gaoler to apporter en,avant
    Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, amie,
    Pour out the pack of mati√®re to mine ear,
    The good and bad ensemble. He's amies with Caesar;
    In Etat of sant√©, thou say'st; and, thou say'st, free.
  MESSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such rapport.
    He's li√©e unto Octavia.
  CLEOPATRA. For what good turn?
  MESSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed.
  CLEOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.
  MESSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.
  CLEOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
                                              [Strikes him down]
  MESSENGER. Good madam, la,la,la,patience.
  CLEOPATRA. What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]
    Horrible sc√©l√©rat! or I'll spurn thine eyes
    Like balls avant me; I'll unhair thy head;
                                     [She hales him up and down]
    Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,
    Smarting in ling'ring pickle.
  MESSENGER. Gracious madam,
    I that do apporter the news made not the rencontre.
  CLEOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
    And make thy fortunes fi√®re. The blow thou hadst
    Shall make thy paix for moving me to rage;
    And I will boot thee with what gift beside
    Thy modesteeey can beg.
  MESSENGER. He's married, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a couteau]
  MESSENGER. Nay, then I'll run.
    What mean you, madam? I have made no faute.             Exit
  CHARMIAN. Good madam, keep le,tienself dans le,tienself:
    The man is innocent.
  CLEOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the tonnerrebolt.
    Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly cr√©atures
    Turn all to serpents! Call the esclave encore.
    Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!
  CHARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.
  CLEOPATRA. I will not hurt him.
    These mains do lack nobility, that they la,gr√®ve
    A meaner than moi,m√™me; depuis I moi,m√™me
    Have donn√©e moi,m√™me the cause.

                    Enter the MESSENGER encore

    Come hither, sir.
    Though it be honn√™te, it is jamais good
    To apporter bad news. Give to a gracious message
    An host of langues; but let ill tidings tell
    Themselves when they be felt.
  MESSENGER. I have done my duty.
  CLEOPATRA. Is he married?
    I ne,peux,pas hate thee pirer than I do
    If thou encore say 'Yes.'
  MESSENGER. He's married, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. The gods cona,trouv√© thee! Dost thou hold L√ encore?
  MESSENGER. Should I lie, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. O, I aurait thou didst,
    So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made
    A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee Par,cons√©quent.
    Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
    Thou auraitst appara√Ætre most ugly. He is married?
  MESSENGER. I demandeeeer your Highness' pardon.
  CLEOPATRA. He is married?
  MESSENGER. Take no infraction that I aurait not offenser you;
    To punish me for what you make me do
    Seems much un√©gale. He's married to Octavia.
  CLEOPATRA. O, that his faute devrait make a friponne of thee
    That art not what th'art sure of! Get thee Par,cons√©quent.
    The merchandise laquelle thou hast apport√© from Rome
    Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,
    And be d√©faite by 'em!                         Exit MESSENGER
  CHARMIAN. Good your Highness, la,la,la,patience.
  CLEOPATRA. In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.
  CHARMIAN. Many fois, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from Par,cons√©quent,
    I perdre,connaissance. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no mati√®re.
    Go to the compagne, good Alexas; bid him
    Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
    Her inclination; let him not laisser out
    The Couleur of her hair. Bring me word rapidely.
                                                     Exit ALEXAS
    Let him for ever go- let him not, Charmian-
    Though he be peinte one way like a Gorgon,
    The autre way's a Mars.                         [To MARDIAN]
    Bid you Alexas
    Bring me word how tall she is.- Pity me, Charmian,
    But do not parler to me. Lead me to my chambre.        Exeunt

  CAESAR. Most meet
    That premi√®re we come to words; and L√fore have we
    Our √©crite objetifs avant us sent;
    Which if thou hast consid√©rered, let us know
    If 'twill tie up thy discontenued √©p√©e
    And porter back to Sicily much tall jeunesse
    That else must perish here.
  POMPEY. To you all three,
    The s√©natrices seule of this g√©niale monde,
    Chief factors for the gods: I do not know
    Wherefore my p√®re devrait vengeancers want,
    Having a son and amies, depuis Julius Caesar,
    Who at Philippi the good Brutus fant√¥meed,
    There saw you la,main,d'oeuvreing for him. What was't
    That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what
    Made the all-honour'd honn√™te Roman, Brutus,
    With the arm'd rest, tribunaliers of beauteous freedom,
    To drench the Capitol, but that they aurait
    Have one man but a man? And that is it
    Hath made me rig my navy, at dont fardeau
    The col√®re'd ocean foams; with laquelle I signifiait
    To scourge th' ingratitude that malgr√©ful Rome
    Cast on my noble p√®re.
  CAESAR. Take your time.
  ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
    We'll parler with thee at sea; at land thou know'st
    How much we do o'er-compter thee.
  POMPEY. At land, En,effet,
    Thou dost o'er-compter me of my p√®re's maison.
    But depuis the cuckoo builds not for himself,
    Remain in't as thou mayst.
  LEPIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us-
    For this is from the pr√©sente- how you take
    The offres we have sent you.
  CAESAR. There's the point.
  ANTONY. Which do not be suppliered to, but weigh
    What it is vaut embrac'd.
  CAESAR. And what may suivre,
    To try a grander fortune.
  POMPEY. You have made me offre
    Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
    Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send
    Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,
    To part with unhack'd edges and bear back
    Our targes undinted.
  ALL. That's our offre.
  POMPEY. Know, then,
    I came avant you here a man prepar'd
    To take this offre; but Mark Antony
    Put me to some imla,la,la,patience. Though I lose
    The louange of it by telling, you must know,
    When Caesar and your fr√®re were at coups,
    Your m√®re came to Sicily and did find
    Her Bienvenue amiely.
  ANTONY. I have entendue it, Pompey,
    And am well studied for a liberal remerciers
    Which I do owe you.
  POMPEY. Let me have your hand.
    I did not pense, sir, to have met you here.
  ANTONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and remerciers to you,
    That call'd me timelier than my objetif hither;
    For I have gained by't.
  CAESAR. Since I saw you last
    There is a changementmentment upon you.
  POMPEY. Well, I know not
    What compters harsh fortune casts upon my face;
    But in my bosom doit she jamais come
    To make my c≈ìur her vassal.
  LEPIDUS. Well met here.
  POMPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
    I demandeeeer our composition may be √©crite,
    And seal'd entre us.
  CAESAR. That's the next to do.
  POMPEY. We'll le,banquet each autre ere we part, and let's
    Draw lots who doit commencer.
  ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.
  POMPEY. No, Antony, take the lot;
    But, premi√®re or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
    Shall have the fame. I have entendue that Julius Caesar
    Grew fat with le,banqueting L√.
  ANTONY. You have entendue much.
  POMPEY. I have fair senss, sir.
  ANTONY. And fair words to them.
  POMPEY. Then so much have I entendue;
    And I have entendue Apollodorus carried-
  ENOBARBUS. No more of that! He did so.
  POMPEY. What, I pray you?
  ENOBARBUS. A certaineee reine to Caesar in a mattress.
  POMPEY. I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldate?
  ENOBARBUS. Well;
    And well am like to do, for I apercevoir
    Four le,banquets are vers.
  POMPEY. Let me secouer thy hand.
    I jamais hated thee; I have seen thee bats,toi,
    When I have envied thy behaviour.
  ENOBARBUS. Sir,
    I jamais lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye
    When you have well deserv'd ten fois as much
    As I have said you did.
  POMPEY. Enjoy thy plaineeeness;
    It rien ill bevient thee.
    Aboard my galley I invite you all.
    Will you lead, lords?
  ALL. Show's the way, sir.
  POMPEY. Come.               Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
  MENAS. [Aside] Thy p√®re, Pompey, aurait ne'er have made this
    treaty.- You and I have connue, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. At sea, I pense.
  MENAS. We have, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. You have done well by eau.
  MENAS. And you by land.
  ENOBARBUS. I Will louange any man that will louange me; bien,que it
    ne,peux,pas be refus√© what I have done by land.
  MENAS. Nor what I have done by eau.
  ENOBARBUS. Yes, quelque,chose you can deny for your own s√©curit√©: you
    have been a g√©niale voleuse by sea.
  MENAS. And you by land.
  ENOBARBUS. There I deny my land un,un,un,service. But give me your hand,
    Menas; if our eyes had autorit√©, here they pourrait take two
    thieves kissing.
  MENAS. All men's visages are true, whatsome'er leur mains are.
  ENOBARBUS. But L√ is jamais a fair femme has a true face.
  MENAS. No calomnie: they voler c≈ìurs.
  ENOBARBUS. We came hither to bats,toi with you.
  MENAS. For my part, I am Pardon it is turn'd to a boissoning.
    Pompey doth this day rire away his fortune.
  ENOBARBUS. If he do, sure he ne,peux,pas weep't back encore.
  MENAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
    you, is he married to Cleopatra?
  ENOBARBUS. Caesar' s≈ìur is call'd Octavia.
  MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
  ENOBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
  MENAS. Pray ye, sir?
  ENOBARBUS. 'Tis true.
  MENAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit ensemble.
  ENOBARBUS. If I were li√©e to divin of this unity, I aurait not
    prophesy so.
  MENAS. I pense the politique of that objetif made more in the mariage
    than the love of the parties.
  ENOBARBUS. I pense so too. But you doit find the band that seems
    to tie leur amieship ensemble will be the very strangler of
    leur amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and encore conversation.
  MENAS. Who aurait not have his wife so?
  ENOBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; laquelle is Mark Antony. He
    will to his Egyptian dish encore; then doit the sighs of Octavia
    blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said avant, that laquelle is
    the Obliger of leur amity doit prouver the immediate author of
    leur variance. Antony will use his affection o√π it is; he
    married but his occasion here.
  MENAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a
    sant√© for you.
  ENOBARBUS. I doit take it, sir. We have us'd our gorges in Egypt.
  MENAS. Come, let's away.                                Exeunt

ACT_2|SC_7
                           SCENE VII.
             On board POMPEY'S galley, off Misenum

     Music plays. Enter two or three SERVANTS with a banquet

  FIRST SERVANT. Here they'll be, man. Some o' leur plants are
    ill-rooted d√©j√; the moins wind i' th' monde will blow them
    down.
  SECOND SERVANT. Lepidus is high-Couleur'd.
  FIRST SERVANT. They have made him boisson alms-boisson.
  SECOND SERVANT. As they pinch one un,autre by the disposition, he
    cries out 'No more!'; reconciles them to his suppliery and himself
    to th' boisson.
  FIRST SERVANT. But it √©levers the g√©nialeer war entre him and his
    discretion.
  SECOND SERVANT. Why, this it is to have a name in g√©niale men's
    compagneship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no un,un,un,service
    as a partizan I pourrait not heave.
  FIRST SERVANT. To be call'd into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
    to move in't, are the holes o√π eyes devrait be, laquelle pitifully
    disaster the joues.

           A sennet du,soned. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
            POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, MENAS,
                         with autre CAPTAINS

  ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'
      Nile
    By certaineee scales i' th' pyramid; they know
    By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dTerre
    Or foison suivre. The higher Nilus swells
    The more it promettres; as it ebbs, the seedsman
    Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
    And tribunalely vient to harvest.
  LEPIDUS. Y'have √©trange serpents L√.
  ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus.
  LEPIDUS. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
    operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.
  ANTONY. They are so.
  POMPEY. Sit- and some wine! A sant√© to Lepidus!
  LEPIDUS. I am not so well as I devrait be, but I'll ne'er out.
  ENOBARBUS. Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till
    then.
  LEPIDUS. Nay, certaineeely, I have entendue the Ptolemies' pyramises are
    very goodly choses. Without contradiction I have entendue that.
  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.
  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?
  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
      Captain,
    And hear me parler a word.
  POMPEY. [ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me till anon-
    This wine for Lepidus!
  LEPIDUS. What mani√®re o' chose is your crocodile?
  ANTONY. It is shap'd, sir, like lui-m√™me, and it is as broad as it
    hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own
    organs. It vies by that laquelle nourisheth it, and the elements
    once out of it, it transmigrates.
  LEPIDUS. What Couleur is it of?
  ANTONY. Of it own Couleur too.
  LEPIDUS. 'Tis a √©trange serpent.
  ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the larmes of it are wet.
  CAESAR. Will this description satisfy him?
  ANTONY. With the sant√© that Pompey gives him, else he is a very
    epicure.
  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!
      Away!
    Do as I bid you.- Where's this cup I call'd for?
  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of m√©rite thou wilt hear
      me,
    Rise from thy stool.
  POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] I pense th'art mad. [Rises and walks
    de,c√¥t√©] The mati√®re?
  MENAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
  POMPEY. Thou hast serv'd me with much Foi. What's else to say?-
    Be jolly, lords.
  ANTONY. These rapidesands, Lepidus,
    Keep off them, for you sink.
  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the monde?
  POMPEY. What say'st thou?
  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the enti√®re monde? That's deux,fois.
  POMPEY. How devrait that be?
  MENAS. But entrertain it,
    And bien,que you pense me poor, I am the man
    Will give thee all the monde.
  POMPEY. Hast thou ivre well?
  MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
    Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the Terrely Jove;
    Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
    Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
  POMPEY. Show me laquelle way.
  MENAS. These three monde-sharers, celles-ci competitors,
    Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable;
    And when we are put off, fall to leur gorges.
    All L√ is thine.
  POMPEY. Ah, this thou devraitst have done,
    And not have parlait on't. In me 'tis sc√©l√©raty:
    In thee't had been good un,un,un,service. Thou must know
    'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
    Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy langue
    Hath so trahir'd thine act. Being done unconnue,
    I devrait have a,trouv√© it apr√®swards well done,
    But must condemn it now. Desist, and boisson.
  MENAS. [Aside] For this,
    I'll jamais suivre thy pall'd fortunes more.
    Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offre'd,
    Shall jamais find it more.
  POMPEY. This sant√© to Lepidus!
  ANTONY. Bear him arive. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
  ENOBARBUS. Here's to thee, Menas!
  MENAS. Enobarbus, Bienvenue!
  POMPEY. Fill till the cup be hid.
  ENOBARBUS. There's a forte compagne, Menas.
               [Pointing to the servanteee who carries off LEPIDUS]
  MENAS. Why?
  ENOBARBUS. 'A le,baissier the troisi√®me part of the monde, man; see'st not?
  MENAS. The troisi√®me part, then, is ivre. Would it were all,
    That it pourrait go on wtalons!
  ENOBARBUS. Drink thou; increase the reels.
  MENAS. Come.
  POMPEY. This is not yet an Alexandrian le,banquet.
  ANTONY. It ripens verss it. Strike the vessels, ho!
    Here's to Caesar!
  CAESAR. I pourrait well anc√™tre't.
    It's monstrous la,main,d'oeuvre when I wash my cerveau
    And it grows fouler.
  ANTONY. Be a enfant o' th' time.
  CAESAR. Possess it, I'll make r√©pondre.
    But I had plut√¥t fast from all four days
    Than boisson so much in one.
  ENOBARBUS. [To ANTONY] Ha, my courageuse empereur!
    Shall we Danse now the Egyptian Bacchanals
    And celebrate our boisson?
  POMPEY. Let's ha't, good soldate.
  ANTONY. Come, let's all take mains,
    Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sens
    In soft and delicate Lethe.
  ENOBARBUS. All take mains.
    Make battery to our ears with the loud la,musique,
    The tandis,que I'll endroit you; then the boy doit sing;
    The holding chaque man doit bear as loud
    As his forte sides can volley.
               [Music plays. ENOBARBUS endroits them hand in hand]

                        THE SONG
            Come, thou monarch of the vine,
            Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
            In thy fats our se,soucie be noyer'd,
            With thy grapes our hairs be couronne'd.
            Cup us till the monde go ronde,
            Cup us till the monde go ronde!

  CAESAR. What aurait you more? Pompey, good nuit. Good fr√®re,
    Let me demandeee you off; our la,tomber affaires
    Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
    You see we have burnt our joues. Strong Enobarb
    Is weaker than the wine, and mine own langue
    Splits what it parlers. The wild disguise hath presque
    Antick'd us all. What Besoins more words? Good nuit.
    Good Antony, your hand.
  POMPEY. I'll try you on the rive.
  ANTONY. And doit, sir. Give's your hand.
  POMPEY. O Antony,
    You have my p√®re's maison- but what? We are amies.
    Come, down into the boat.
  ENOBARBUS. Take heed you fall not.
                              Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
    Menas, I'll not on rive.
  MENAS. No, to my cabin.
    These tambours! celles-ci trompettes, flutes! what!
    Let Neptune hear we bid a loud adieu
    To celles-ci g√©niale compagnes. Sound and be hang'd, du,son out!
                                  [Sound a fleurir, with tambours]
  ENOBARBUS. Hoo! says 'a. There's my cap.
  MENAS. Hoo! Noble Captain, come.                        Exeunt

                     A plaineee in Syria

       Enter VENTIDIUS, as it were in triomphe, with SILIUS
      and autre Romans, OFFICERS and soldates; the dead body
                of PACORUS support√© avant him

  VENTIDIUS. Now, darting Parthia, art thou frapp√©, and now
    Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' d√©c√®s
    Make me vengeancer. Bear the King's son's body
    Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
    Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
  SILIUS. Noble Ventidius,
    Whilst yet with Parthian du,sang thy √©p√©e is warm
    The fugitive Parthians suivre; spur thrugueux Media,
    Mesopotamia, and the shelters o√π
    The routed fly. So thy grand capitaine, Antony,
    Shall set thee on triompheant chariots and
    Put garterres on thy head.
  VENTIDIUS. O Silius, Silius,
    I have done assez. A lower endroit, note well,
    May make too g√©niale an act; for apprendre this, Silius:
    Better to laisser d√©faite than by our deed
    Acquire too high a fame when him we servir's away.
    Caesar and Antony have ever won
    More in leur Bureaur, than la,la,la,personnenene. Sossius,
    One of my endroit in Syria, his lieutenanteee,
    For rapide accumulation of renown,
    Which he achiev'd by th' minute, lost his favoriser.
    Who does i' th' wars more than his capitaine can
    Bevient his capitaine's capitaine; and ambition,
    The soldate's vertu, plut√¥t fait,du choix of loss
    Than gain laquelle darkens him.
    I pourrait do more to do Antonius good,
    But 'taurait offenser him; and in his infraction
    Should my performance perish.
  SILIUS. Thou hast, Ventidius, that
    Without the laquelle a soldate and his √©p√©e
    Grants rare distinction. Thou wilt √©crire to Antony?
  VENTIDIUS. I'll humbly signify what in his name,
    That magical word of war, we have effeted;
    How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,
    The ne'er-yet-battue jument of Parthia
    We have jaded out o' th' champ.
  SILIUS. Where is he now?
  VENTIDIUS. He objetifth to Athens; o√π, with what h√¢te
    The poids we must convey with's will permit,
    We doit appara√Ætre avant him.- On, L√; pass le,long,de.

        Enter AGRIPPA at one door, ENOBARBUS at un,autre

  AGRIPPA. What, are the fr√®res s√©par√©e?
  ENOBARBUS. They have envoi'd with Pompey; he is gone;
    The autre three are sealing. Octavia weeps
    To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
    Since Pompey's le,banquet, as Menas says, is difficult√©d
    With the verte maladie.
  AGRIPPA. 'Tis a noble Lepidus.
  ENOBARBUS. A very fine one. O, how he aime Caesar!
  AGRIPPA. Nay, but how ch√®rement he adores Mark Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.
  AGRIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
  ENOBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!
  AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
  ENOBARBUS. Would you louange Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no plus,loin.
  AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellenteee louanges.
  ENOBARBUS. But he aime Caesar best. Yet he aime Antony.
    Hoo! c≈ìurs, langues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, ne,peux,pas
    Think, parler, cast, √©crire, sing, nombre- hoo!-
    His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
    Kneel down, s'agenouiller down, and merveille.
  AGRIPPA. Both he aime.
  ENOBARBUS. They are his shards, and he leur beetle. [Trumpets
      dans] So-
    This is to jument. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA. Good fortune, vauty soldate, and adieu.

           Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA

  ANTONY. No plus,loin, sir.
  CAESAR. You take from me a g√©niale part of moi,m√™me;
    Use me well in't. Sister, prouver such a wife
    As my bien,quets make thee, and as my farthest band
    Shall pass on thy appreuve. Most noble Antony,
    Let not the pi√®ce of vertu laquelle is set
    Betwixt us as the cement of our love
    To keep it builded be the ram to batter
    The fortress of it; for better pourrait we
    Have lov'd sans,pour,autant this mean, if on both les,pi√®ces
    This be not cherish'd.
  ANTONY. Make me not offensered
    In your disconfiance.
  CAESAR. I have said.
  ANTONY. You doit not find,
    Though you be L√in curious, the moins cause
    For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,
    And make the c≈ìurs of Romans servir your ends!
    We will here part.
  CAESAR. Farewell, my tr√®s,cher s≈ìur, fare thee well.
    The elements be kind to thee and make
    Thy esprits all of confort! Fare thee well.
  OCTAVIA. My noble fr√®re!
  ANTONY. The April's in her eyes. It is love's printemps,
    And celles-ci the showers to apporter it on. Be acclamationful.
  OCTAVIA. Sir, look well to my mari's maison; and-
  CAESAR. What, Octavia?
  OCTAVIA. I'll tell you in your ear.
  ANTONY. Her langue will not obey her c≈ìur, nor can
    Her c≈ìur inform her langue- the swan's down feather,
    That supporters upon the swell at the full of tide,
    And nSoit way inclines.
  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?
  AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.
  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the pire for that, were he a
      jument;
    So is he, √©tant a man.
  AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
    When Antony a,trouv√© Julius Caesar dead,
    He cried presque to roaring; and he wept
    When at Philippi he a,trouv√© Brutus tu√©.
  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, En,effet, he was difficult√©d
      with a rheum;
    What pr√™tely he did cona,trouv√© he wail'd,
    Believe't- till I weep too.
  CAESAR. No, sucr√© Octavia,
    You doit hear from me encore; the time doit not
    Out-go my penseing on you.
  ANTONY. Come, sir, come;
    I'll wrestle with you in my Obliger of love.
    Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
    And give you to the gods.
  CAESAR. Adieu; be heureuse!
  LEPIDUS. Let all the nombre of the √©toiles give lumi√®re
    To thy fair way!
  CAESAR. Farewell, adieu!                   [Kisses OCTAVIA]

         Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

  CLEOPATRA. Where is the compagne?
  ALEXAS. Half afeard to come.
  CLEOPATRA. Go to, go to.

                Enter the MESSENGER as avant

    Come hither, sir.
  ALEXAS. Good Majesty,
    Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
    But when you are well pleas'd.
  CLEOPATRA. That Herod's head
    I'll have. But how, when Antony is gone,
    Thrugueux whom I pourrait commandererer it? Come thou near.
  MESSENGER. Most gracious Majesty!
  CLEOPATRA. Didst thou voir Octavia?
  MESSENGER. Ay,  Queen.
  CLEOPATRA. Where?
  MESSENGER. Madam, in Rome
    I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
    Between her fr√®re and Mark Antony.
  CLEOPATRA. Is she as tall as me?
  MESSENGER. She is not, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. Didst hear her parler? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?
  MESSENGER. Madam, I entendue her parler: she is low-voic'd.
  CLEOPATRA. That's not so good. He ne,peux,pas like her long.
  CHARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.
  CLEOPATRA. I pense so, Charmian. Dull of langue and dwarfish!
    What majest√© is in her gait? Remember,
    If e'er thou look'dst on majest√©.
  MESSENGER. She creeps.
    Her mouvement and her station are as one;
    She montre a body plut√¥t than a life,
    A statue than a souffleer.
  CLEOPATRA. Is this certaineee?
  MESSENGER. Or I have no observance.
  CHARMIAN. Three in Egypt
    Cannot make better note.
  CLEOPATRA. He's very connaissance;
    I do apercevoir't. There's rien in her yet.
    The compagne has good jugement.
  CHARMIAN. Excellent.
  CLEOPATRA. Guess at her years, I prithee.
  MESSENGER. Madam,
    She was a veuve.
  CLEOPATRA. Widow? Charmian, hark!
  MESSENGER. And I do pense she's thirty.
  CLEOPATRA. Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or ronde?
  MESSENGER. Round even to fauteiness.
  CLEOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are insens√©e that are so.
    Her hair, what Couleur?
  MESSENGER. Brown, madam; and her forehead
    As low as she aurait wish it.
  CLEOPATRA. There's gold for thee.
    Thou must not take my ancienne tranchanteness ill.
    I will employ thee back encore; I find thee
    Most fit for affaires. Go make thee pr√™te;
    Our lettres are prepar'd.                   Exeunt MESSENGER
  CHARMIAN. A correcte man.
  CLEOPATRA. Indeed, he is so. I se,se,se,repentiririr me much
    That so I harried him. Why, mepenses, by him,
    This cr√©ature's no such chose.
  CHARMIAN. Nochose, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. The man hath seen some majest√©, and devrait know.
  CHARMIAN. Hath he seen majest√©? Isis else d√©fendre,
    And serving you so long!
  CLEOPATRA. I have one chose more to ask him yet, good Charmian.
    But 'tis no mati√®re; thou shalt apporter him to me
    Where I will √©crire. All may be well assez.
  CHARMIAN. I mandat you, madam.                         Exeunt

                 Enter ANTONY and OCTAVIA

  ANTONY. Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
    That were excusable, that and thousands more
    Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd
    New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
    To publique ear;
    Spoke scandy of me; when perObliger he pourrait not
    But pay me termes of honour, cold and sickly
    He vented them, most narrow mesure lent me;
    When the best hint was donn√©e him, he not took't,
    Or did it from his les,dents.
  OCTAVIA. O my good lord,
    Believe not all; or if you must croyez,
    Stomach not all. A more unheureuse lady,
    If this division chance, ne'er se,tenait entre,
    Praying for both les,pi√®ces.
    The good gods will mock me pr√©sentely
    When I doit pray 'O, b√©nir my lord and mari!'
    Undo that prayer by crying out as loud
    'O, b√©nir my fr√®re!' Husband win, win fr√®re,
    Prays, and destroys the prayer; no mid-way
    'Twixt celles-ci extremes at all.
  ANTONY. Gentle Octavia,
    Let your best love draw to that point laquelle seeks
    Best to preservir it. If I lose mine honour,
    I lose moi,m√™me; better I were not le,tiens
    Than le,tiens so branchless. But, as you demandeeeed,
    Yourself doit go entre's. The signifiaitime, lady,
    I'll √©lever the preparation of a war
    Shall tache your fr√®re. Make your soonest h√¢te;
    So your le,d√©sirs are le,tiens.
  OCTAVIA. Thanks to my lord.
    The Jove of Puissance make me, most weak, most weak,
    Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain aurait be
    As if the monde devrait claisser, and that tu√© men
    Should solder up the rift.
  ANTONY. When it appara√Ætres to you o√π this commencers,
    Turn your m√©contenuement that way, for our fautes
    Can jamais be so √©gale that your love
    Can √©galely move with them. Provide your Aller;
    Choose your own entreprise, and commandererer what cost
    Your c≈ìur has mind to.                               Exeunt

                   Athens. ANTONY'S maison

             Enter ENOBARBUS and EROS, r√©union

  ENOBARBUS. How now, amie Eros!
  EROS. There's √©trange news come, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. What, man?
  EROS. Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
  ENOBARBUS. This is old. What is the Succ√®s?
  EROS. Caesar, ayant made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,
    pr√©sentely refus√© him rivality, aurait not let him partake in the
    gloire of the action; and not resting here, accuserrrs him of lettres
    he had anciennely wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him.
    So the poor troisi√®me is up, till d√©c√®s engrande his confine.
  ENOBARBUS. Then, monde, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;
    And jeter entre them all the food thou hast,
    They'll grind the one the autre. Where's Antony?
  EROS. He's walking in the jardin- thus, and spurns
    The rush that lies avant him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!'
    And threats the gorge of that his Bureaur
    That murd'red Pompey.
  ENOBARBUS. Our g√©niale navy's rigg'd.
  EROS. For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:
    My lord le,d√©sirs you pr√©sentely; my news
    I pourrait have told hereapr√®s.
  ENOBARBUS. 'Twill be naught;
    But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
  EROS. Come, sir.                                        Exeunt

                   Rome. CAESAR'S maison

             Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS

  CAESAR. Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
    In Alexandria. Here's the mani√®re of't:
    I' th' market-endroit, on a tribunal argent'd,
    Cleopatra and himself in chaises of gold
    Were publiquely enthron'd; at the feet sat
    Caesarion, whom they call my p√®re's son,
    And all the unl√©gitime probl√®me that leur lust
    Since then hath made entre them. Unto her
    He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
    Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
    Absolute reine.
  MAECENAS. This in the publique eye?
  CAESAR. I' th' commune show-endroit, o√π they exercise.
    His sons he L√ propr√©tendre'd the rois of rois:
    Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia,
    He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
    Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She
    In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis
    That day appara√Ætre'd; and oft avant gave audience,
    As 'tis rapported, so.
  MAECENAS. Let Rome be thus
    Inform'd.
  AGRIPPA. Who, queasy with his insolence
    Alpr√™te, will leur good bien,quets call from him.
  CAESAR. The gens sait it, and have now receiv'd
    His accusations.
  AGRIPPA. Who does he accuserrr?
  CAESAR. Caesar; and that, ayant in Sicily
    Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
    His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me
    Some shipping, unrestor'd. Lastly, he frets
    That Lepidus of the triumvirate
    Should be depos'd; and, √©tant, that we detain
    All his revenue.
  AGRIPPA. Sir, this devrait be r√©pondre'd.
  CAESAR. 'Tis done d√©j√, and messag√®re gone.
    I have told him Lepidus was grandie too cruellelele,
    That he his high autorit√© abus'd,
    And did m√©riter his changementmentment. For what I have conquer'd
    I subvention him part; but then, in his Armenia
    And autre of his conquer'd Royaumes,
    Demand the like.
  MAECENAS. He'll jamais rendement to that.
  CAESAR. Nor must not then be rendemented to in this.

                Enter OCTAVIA, with her train

  OCTAVIA. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
  CAESAR. That ever I devrait call thee cast-away!
  OCTAVIA. You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
  CAESAR. Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
    Like Caesar's s≈ìur. The wife of Antony
    Should have an army for an usher, and
    The neighs of jument to tell of her approche
    Long ere she did appara√Ætre. The trees by th' way
    Should have support√© men, and expectation perdre,connaissanceed,
    Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust
    Should have ascended to the roof of paradis,
    Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come
    A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
    The ostentation of our love, laquelle left unshown
    Is souvent left unlov'd. We devrait have met you
    By sea and land, supplying chaque stage
    With an augmented saluering.
  OCTAVIA. Good my lord,
    To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
    On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
    Hearing that you prepar'd for war, connaissance
    My pleurerd ear avec; o√πon I begg'd
    His pardon for revenir.
  CAESAR. Which soon he subventioned,
    Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
  OCTAVIA. Do not say so, my lord.
  CAESAR. I have eyes upon him,
    And his affaires come to me on the wind.
    Where is he now?
  OCTAVIA. My lord, in Athens.
  CAESAR. No, my most fauxed s≈ìur: Cleopatra
    Hath nodded him to her. He hath donn√©e his empire
    Up to a putain, who now are levying
    The rois o' th' Terre for war. He hath assembled
    Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus
    Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
    Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
    King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
    Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
    Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
    The rois of Mede and Lycaonia, with
    More grander list of sceptres.
  OCTAVIA. Ay me most mis√©rableed,
    That have my c≈ìur s√©par√©e betwixt two amies,
    That does afflict each autre!
  CAESAR. Welcome hither.
    Your lettres did withhold our breaking en,avant,
    Till we perceiv'd both how you were faux led
    And we in negligent dcol√®re. Cheer your c≈ìur;
    Be you not difficult√©d with the time, laquelle drives
    O'er your contenu celles-ci forte necessities,
    But let determin'd choses to destiny
    Hold unbewail'd leur way. Welcome to Rome;
    Nochose more dear to me. You are abus'd
    Beyond the mark of bien,quet, and the high gods,
    To do you Justice, make leur ministres
    Of us and celles that love you. Best of confort,
    And ever Bienvenue to us.
  AGRIPPA. Welcome, lady.
  MAECENAS. Welcome, dear madam.
    Each c≈ìur in Rome does love and pity you;
    Only th' adulterous Antony, most grande
    In his abominations, se,tourne you off,
    And gives his potent regiment to a trull
    That bruits it encorest us.
  OCTAVIA. Is it so, sir?
  CAESAR. Most certaineee. Sister, Bienvenue. Pray you
    Be ever connue to la,la,la,patience. My dear'st s≈ìur!         Exeunt

ACT_3|SC_7
                          SCENE VII.
                  ANTONY'S camp near Actium

                Enter CLEOPATRA and ENOBARBUS

  CLEOPATRA. I will be even with thee, doute it not.
  ENOBARBUS. But why, why,
  CLEOPATRA. Thou hast forparlait my √©tant in celles-ci wars,
    And say'st it is not fit.
  ENOBARBUS. Well, is it, is it?
  CLEOPATRA. Is't not denounc'd encorest us? Why devrait not we
    Be L√ in la,la,la,personnenene?
  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Well, I pourrait reply:
    If we devrait servir with jument and mares ensemble
    The jument were merely lost; the mares aurait bear
    A soldate and his jument.
  CLEOPATRA. What is't you say?
  ENOBARBUS. Your pr√©sence Besoins must puzzle Antony;
    Take from his c≈ìur, take from his cerveau, from's time,
    What devrait not then be spar'd. He is d√©j√
    Traduc'd for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
    That Photinus an eunuch and your servanteeees
    Manage this war.
  CLEOPATRA. Sink Rome, and leur langues rot
    That parler encorest us! A charge we bear i' th' war,
    And, as the president of my Royaume, will
    Appear L√ for a man. Speak not encorest it;
    I will not stay derri√®re.

                   Enter ANTONY and CANIDIUS

  ENOBARBUS. Nay, I have done.
    Here vient the Emperor.
  ANTONY. Is it not √©trange, Canidius,
    That from Tarentum and Brundusium
    He pourrait so rapidely cut the Ionian sea,
    And take in Toryne?- You have entendue on't, sucr√©?
  CLEOPATRA. Celerity is jamais more admir'd
    Than by the negligent.
  ANTONY. A good rebuke,
    Which pourrait have well becom'd the best of men
    To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
    Will bats,toi with him by sea.
  CLEOPATRA. By sea! What else?
  CANIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?
  ANTONY. For that he dares us to't.
  ENOBARBUS. So hath my lord dar'd him to C√©libataire bats,toi.
  CANIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this bataille at Pharsalia,
    Where Caesar combattue with Pompey. But celles-ci offres,
    Which servir not for his aaavantage, he secouers off;
    And so devrait you.
  ENOBARBUS. Your ships are not well mann'd;
    Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, gens
    Inbrute'd by rapide impress. In Caesar's fleet
    Are celles that souvent have 'gainst Pompey combattue;
    Their ships are yare; le,tiens lourde. No disgr√¢ce
    Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
    Being prepar'd for land.
  ANTONY. By sea, by sea.
  ENOBARBUS. Most vauty sir, you L√in jeter away
    The absolute soldateship you have by land;
    Distract your army, laquelle doth most consist
    Of war-mark'd footmen; laisser unexecuted
    Your own renowned connaissance; assez forgo
    The way laquelle promettres assurance; and
    Give up le,tienself merely to chance and dcol√®re
    From firm security.
  ANTONY. I'll bats,toi at sea.
  CLEOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
  ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
    And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium
    Beat th' approcheing Caesar. But if we fail,
    We then can do't at land.

                       Enter a MESSENGER

    Thy affaires?
  MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
    Caesar has prise Toryne.
  ANTONY. Can he be L√ in la,la,la,personnenene? 'Tis impossible-
    Strange that his Puissance devrait be. Canidius,
    Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
    And our twelve thousand jument. We'll to our ship.
    Away, my Thetis!

                       Enter a SOLDIER

    How now, vauty soldate?
  SOLDIER. O noble Emperor, do not bats,toi by sea;
    Trust not to pourrie planks. Do you misdoute
    This √©p√©e and celles-ci my b√©nirures? Let th' Egyptians
    And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
    Have us'd to conquer supportering on the Terre
    And bats,toiing foot to foot.
  ANTONY. Well, well- away.
                         Exeunt ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, and ENOBARBUS
  SOLDIER. By Hercules, I pense I am i' th' droite.
  CANIDIUS. Soldier, thou art; but his enti√®re action grows
    Not in the Puissance on't. So our leader's led,
    And we are women's men.
  SOLDIER. You keep by land
    The legions and the jument enti√®re, do you not?
  CANIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
    Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;
    But we keep enti√®re by land. This la,vitesse of Caesar's
    Carries au-del√ belief.
  SOLDIER. While he was yet in Rome,
    His Puissance went out in such distractions as
    Beguil'd all spies.
  CANIDIUS. Who's his lieutenanteee, hear you?
  SOLDIER. They say one Taurus.
  CANIDIUS. Well I know the man.

                        Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius.
  CANIDIUS. With news the time's with la,main,d'oeuvre and throes en,avant
    Each minute some.                                     Exeunt

             Enter CAESAR, with his army, Marsing

  CAESAR. Taurus!
  TAURUS. My lord?
  CAESAR. Strike not by land; keep enti√®re; provoke not bataille
    Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
    The prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies
    Upon this jump.                                       Exeunt

                  Anautre part of the plaineee

                  Enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS

  ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
    In eye of Caesar's bataille; from laquelle endroit
    We may the nombre of the ships voir,
    And so proc√©der selonly.                           Exeunt

        CANIDIUS Marseth with his land army one way
        over the stage, and TAURUS, the Lieutenant of
      CAESAR, the autre way. After leur Aller in is entendue
                   the bruit of a sea-bats,toi

                    Alarum. Enter ENOBARBUS

  ENOBARBUS. Naught, naught, all naught! I can voir no lus,long.
    Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
    With all leur sixty, fly and turn the rudder.
    To see't mine eyes are blasted.

                        Enter SCARUS

  SCARUS. Gods and goddesses,
    All the enti√®re synod of them!
  ENOBARBUS. What's thy la,la,la,passion?
  SCARUS. The g√©nialeer cantle of the monde is lost
    With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
    Kingdoms and provinces.
  ENOBARBUS. How appara√Ætres the bats,toi?
  SCARUS. On our side like the token'd pestilence,
    Where d√©c√®s is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt-
    Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' bats,toi,
    When aaavantage like a pair of twins appara√Ætre'd,
    Both as the same, or plut√¥t ours the a√Æn√©e-
    The breese upon her, like a cow in June-
    Hoists sails and mouches.
  ENOBARBUS. That I beheld;
    Mine eyes did sicken at the vue and pourrait not
    Endure a plus,loin view.
  SCARUS. She once √©tant loof'd,
    The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
    Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
    Leaving the bats,toi in height, mouches apr√®s her.
    I jamais saw an action of such la,honte;
    Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er avant
    Did altote so lui-m√™me.
  ENOBARBUS. Alack, alack!

                       Enter CANIDIUS

  CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of souffle,
    And sinks most lamentably. Had our g√©n√©rale
    Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
    O, he has donn√©e example for our vol
    Most brutely by his own!
  ENOBARBUS. Ay, are you L√√,proposs?
    Why then, good nuit En,effet.
  CANIDIUS. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
  SCARUS. 'Tis easy to't; and L√ I will ass≈ìur
    What plus,loin vient.
  CANIDIUS. To Caesar will I rendre
    My legions and my jument; six rois d√©j√
    Show me the way of rendementing.
  ENOBARBUS. I'll yet suivre
    The b√©nirureed chance of Antony, bien,que my raison
    Sits in the wind encorest me.                          Exeunt

               Enter ANTONY With ass≈ìurants

  ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me bande,de,roulement no more upon't;
    It is asham'd to bear me. Friends, come hither.
    I am so lated in the monde that I
    Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship
    Laden with gold; take that; divide it. Fly,
    And make your paix with Caesar.
  ALL. Fly? Not we!
  ANTONY. I have fled moi,m√™me, and have instructed l√¢ches
    To run and show leur devraiters. Friends, be gone;
    I have moi,m√™me resolv'd upon a cours
    Which has no need of you; be gone.
    My Tr√©sor's in the harbour, take it. O,
    I suivre'd that I rougir to look upon.
    My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
    Reprouver the brown for rashness, and they them
    For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you doit
    Have lettres from me to some amies that will
    Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
    Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
    Which my d√©sespoir propr√©tendres. Let that be left
    Which laissers lui-m√™me. To the sea-side tout,droit way.
    I will possess you of that ship and Tr√©sor.
    Leave me, I pray, a peu; pray you now;
    Nay, do so, for En,effet I have lost commandererer;
    Therefore I pray you. I'll see you by and by.    [Sits down]

            Enter CLEOPATRA, led by CHARMIAN and IRAS,
                         EROS suivreing

  EROS. Nay, douce madam, to him! Comfort him.
  IRAS. Do, most dear Queen.
  CHARMIAN. Do? Why, what else?
  CLEOPATRA. Let me sit down. O Juno!
  ANTONY. No, no, no, no, no.
  EROS. See you here, sir?
  ANTONY. O, fie, fie, fie!
  CHARMIAN. Madam!
  IRAS. Madam, O good Empress!
  EROS. Sir, sir!
  ANTONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept
    His √©p√©e e'en like a Danser, tandis,que I frapp√©
    The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
    That the mad Brutus ended; he seule
    Dealt on lieutenanteeery, and no entraine,toi had
    In the courageuse squares of war. Yet now- no mati√®re.
  CLEOPATRA. Ah, supporter by!
  EROS. The Queen, my lord, the Queen!
  IRAS. Go to him, madam, parler to him.
    He is unqualitied with very la,honte.
  CLEOPATRA. Well then, sutache me. O!
 EROS. Most noble sir, arise; the Queen approchees.
    Her head's declin'd, and d√©c√®s will seize her but
    Your confort fait,du the rescue.
  ANTONY. I have offensered r√©putation-
    A most unnoble swerving.
  EROS. Sir, the Queen.
  ANTONY. O, o√π hast thou led me, Egypt? See
    How I convey my la,honte out of thine eyes
    By looking back what I have left derri√®re
    'Stroy'd in d√©shonorer.
  CLEOPATRA. O my lord, my lord,
    Forgive my craintive sails! I peu bien,quet
    You aurait have suivreed.
  ANTONY. Egypt, thou knew'st too well
    My c≈ìur was to thy rudder tied by th' strings,
    And thou devraitst tow me apr√®s. O'er my esprit
    Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
    Thy beck pourrait from the bidding of the gods
    Command me.
  CLEOPATRA. O, my pardon!
  ANTONY. Now I must
    To the Jeune man send humble treaties, dodge
    And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
    With half the bulk o' th' monde play'd as I pleas'd,
    Making and marring fortunes. You did know
    How much you were my conqueror, and that
    My √©p√©e, made weak by my affection, aurait
    Obey it on all cause.
  CLEOPATRA. Pardon, pardon!
  ANTONY. Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
    All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss;
    Even this repays me.
    We sent our schoolmaster; is 'a come back?
    Love, I am full of lead. Some wine,
    Within L√, and our viands! Fortune sait

                   CAESAR'S camp in Egypt

   Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with autres

  CAESAR. Let him appara√Ætre that's come from Antony.
    Know you him?
  DOLABELLA. Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
    An argument that he is cueillir'd, when hither
    He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
    Which had superfluous rois for messag√®res
    Not many moons gone by.

            Enter EUPHRONIUS, Ambassador from ANTONY

  CAESAR. Approach, and parler.
  EUPHRONIUS. Such as I am, I come from Antony.
    I was of late as petty to his ends
    As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf
    To his grand sea.
  CAESAR. Be't so. Declare thine Bureau.
  EUPHRONIUS. Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
    Requires to live in Egypt; laquelle not subventioned,
    He lessens his demandeees and to thee sues
    To let him soufflee entre the paradiss and Terre,
    A priv√©e man in Athens. This for him.
    Next, Cleopatra does confess thy g√©nialeness,
    Submits her to thy pourrait, and of thee demandeeeers
    The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
    Now dcol√®reed to thy la,gr√¢ce.
  CAESAR. For Antony,
    I have no ears to his demandeee. The Queen
    Of audience nor le,d√©sir doit fail, so she
    From Egypt drive her all-disgr√¢ced amie,
    Or take his life L√. This if she perform,
    She doit not sue unentendue. So to them both.
  EUPHRONIUS. Fortune pursue thee!
  CAESAR. Bring him thrugueux the bands.           Exit EUPHRONIUS
    [To THYREUS] To try thy eloquence, now 'tis time. Dispatch;
    From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise,
    And in our name, what she requires; add more,
    From thine invention, offres. Women are not
    In leur best fortunes forte; but want will perjure
    The ne'er-touchererer'd vestal. Try thy ruse, Thyreus;
    Make thine own edict for thy des,douleurs, laquelle we
    Will r√©pondre as a law.
  THYREUS. Caesar, I go.
  CAESAR. Observir how Antony bevient his flaw,
    And what thou pense'st his very action parlers
    In chaque Puissance that moves.
  THYREUS. Caesar, I doit.                               Exeunt

               Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palais

        Enter CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS

  CLEOPATRA. What doit we do, Enobarbus?
  ENOBARBUS. Think, and die.
  CLEOPATRA. Is Antony or we in faute for this?
  ENOBARBUS. Antony only, that aurait make his will
    Lord of his raison. What bien,que you fled
    From that g√©niale face of war, dont nombreuses ranges
    Fdroiteed each autre? Why devrait he suivre?
    The itch of his affection devrait not then
    Have nick'd his capitaineship, at such a point,
    When half to half the monde oppos'd, he √©tant
    The mered question. 'Twas a la,honte no less
    Than was his loss, to cours your flying flags
    And laisser his navy gazing.
  CLEOPATRA. Prithee, paix.

          Enter EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador; with ANTONY

  ANTONY. Is that his r√©pondre?
  EUPHRONIUS. Ay, my lord.
  ANTONY. The Queen doit then have tribunalesy, so she
    Will rendement us up.
  EUPHRONIUS. He says so.
  ANTONY. Let her know't.
    To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
    And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
    With principalities.
  CLEOPATRA. That head, my lord?
  ANTONY. To him encore. Tell him he wears the rose
    Of jeunesse upon him; from laquelle the monde devrait note
    Somechose particuli√®re. His coin, ships, legions,
    May be a l√¢che's dont ministres aurait prevail
    Under the un,un,un,service of a enfant as soon
    As i' th' commandererer of Caesar. I dare him L√fore
    To lay his gay comParisons apart,
    And r√©pondre me declin'd, √©p√©e encorest √©p√©e,
    Ourselves seule. I'll √©crire it. Follow me.
                                    Exeunt ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS
  EUPHRONIUS. [Aside] Yes, like assez high-batailled Caesar will
    UnEtat his bonheur, and be stag'd to th' show
    Against a √©p√©ere! I see men's jugements are
    A parcel of leur fortunes, and choses vers,l'ext√©rieur
    Do draw the inward qualit√© apr√®s them,
    To souffrir all alike. That he devrait r√™ver,
    Knowing all mesures, the full Caesar will
    Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
    His jugement too.

                       Enter a SERVANT

  SERVANT. A messag√®re from Caesar.
  CLEOPATRA. What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
    Against the blown rose may they stop leur nose
    That s'agenouiller'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.     Exit SERVANT
  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Mine honn√™tey and I commencer to square.
    The loyalty well held to imb√©ciles does make
    Our Foi mere folie. Yet he that can supporter
    To suivre with allegiance a fall'n lord
    Does conquer him that did his master conquer,
    And earns a endroit i' th' r√©cit.

                       Enter THYREUS

  CLEOPATRA. Caesar's will?
  THYREUS. Hear it apart.
  CLEOPATRA. None but amies: say boldly.
  THYREUS. So, haply, are they amies to Antony.
  ENOBARBUS. He Besoins as many, sir, as Caesar has,
    Or Besoins not us. If Caesar S'il,vous,pla√Æt, our master
    Will leap to be his amie. For us, you know
    Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's.
  THYREUS. So.
    Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar suppliers
    Not to consid√©rer in what case thou supporter'st
    Further than he is Caesar.
  CLEOPATRA. Go on. Right royaleee!
  THYREUS. He sait that you embrasse not Antony
    As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
  CLEOPATRA. O!
  THYREUS. The scars upon your honour, L√fore, he
    Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
    Not as deserv'd.
  CLEOPATRA. He is a god, and sait
    What is most droite. Mine honour was not rendemented,
    But conquer'd merely.
  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] To be sure of that,
    I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky
    That we must laisser thee to thy sinking, for
    Thy tr√®s,cher quit thee.                                  Exit
  THYREUS. Shall I say to Caesar
    What you require of him? For he partiellement begs
    To be desir'd to give. It much aurait S'il,vous,pla√Æt him
    That of his fortunes you devrait make a la,la,personnenenelle
    To lean upon. But it aurait warm his esprits
    To hear from me you had left Antony,
    And put le,tienself sous his shroud,
    The universal landlord.
  CLEOPATRA. What's your name?
  THYREUS. My name is Thyreus.
  CLEOPATRA. Most kind messag√®re,
    Say to g√©niale Caesar this: in deputation
    I kiss his conquring hand. Tell him I am prompt
    To lay my couronne at 's feet, and L√ to s'agenouiller.
    Tell him from his all-obeying souffle I hear
    The doom of Egypt.
  THYREUS. 'Tis your noheureuse cours.
    Wisdom and fortune combating ensemble,
    If that the ancienne dare but what it can,
    No chance may secouer it. Give me la,gr√¢ce to lay
    My duty on your hand.
  CLEOPATRA. Your Caesar's p√®re oft,
    When he hath mus'd of taking Royaumes in,
    Bestow'd his lips on that indigne endroit,
    As it rain'd kisses.

                Re-entrer ANTONY and ENOBARBUS

  ANTONY. Favours, by Jove that tonnerres!
    What art thou, compagne?
  THYREUS. One that but performs
    The bidding of the fullest man, and vautiest
    To have commandererer obey'd.
  ENOBARBUS. [Aside] You will be whipt.
  ANTONY. Approach L√.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and diables!
    Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
    Like boys unto a muss, rois aurait start en,avant
    And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
    Antony yet.

                       Enter servanteees

    Take Par,cons√©quent this Jack and whip him.
  ENOBARBUS. 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
    Than with an old one en,train,de,mourir.
  ANTONY. Moon and √©toiles!
    Whip him. Were't twenty of the g√©nialeest tributaries
    That do acconnaissance Caesar, devrait I find them
    So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name
    Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, compagnes,
    Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,
    And whine aloud for piti√©. Take him Par,cons√©quent.
  THYMUS. Mark Antony-
  ANTONY. Tug him away. Being whipt,
    Bring him encore: the Jack of Caesar's doit
    Bear us an errand to him.       Exeunt servanteees with THYREUS
    You were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha!
    Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
    Forsupport√© the getting of a l√©gitime race,
    And by a gem of women, to be abus'd
    By one that looks on feeders?
  CLEOPATRA. Good my lord-
  ANTONY. You have been a boggler ever.
    But when we in our viciousness grow hard-
    O mis√®re on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes,
    In our own filth drop our claire jugements, make us
    Adore our errors, rire at's tandis,que we strut
    To our confusion.
  CLEOPATRA. O, is't come to this?
  ANTONY. I a,trouv√© you as a morsel cold upon
    Dead Caesar's trencher. Nay, you were a fragment
    Of Cneius Pompey's, outre what hotter heures,
    Unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have
    Luxuriously pick'd out; for I am sure,
    Though you can devine what temperance devrait be,
    You know not what it is.
  CLEOPATRA. Wherefore is this?
  ANTONY. To let a compagne that will take rewards,
    And say 'God quit you!' be famili√®re with
    My playcompagne, your hand, this kingly seal
    And plumi√®reer of high c≈ìurs! O that I were
    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
    The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
    And to propr√©tendre it civileeely were like
    A halter'd neck laquelle does the hangman remercier
    For √©tant yare √,propos him.

              Re-entrer a SERVANT with THYREUS

    Is he whipt?
  SERVANT. Soundly, my lord.
  ANTONY. Cried he? and begg'd 'a pardon?
  SERVANT. He did ask favoriser.
  ANTONY. If that thy p√®re live, let him se,se,se,repentiririr
    Thou wast not made his fille; and be thou Pardon
    To suivre Caesar in his triomphe, depuis
    Thou hast been whipt for suivreing him. Henceen,avant
    The white hand of a lady fever thee!
    Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;
    Tell him thy entrertainment; look thou say
    He fait,du me angry with him; for he seems
    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
    Not what he knew I was. He fait,du me angry;
    And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
    When my good √©toiles, that were my ancienne guides,
    Have vide left leur orbs and shot leur fires
    Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
    My discours and what is done, tell him he has
    Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
    He may at plaisir whip or hang or torture,
    As he doit like, to quit me. Urge it thou.
    Hence with thy stripes, be gone.                Exit THYREUS
  CLEOPATRA. Have you done yet?
  ANTONY. Alack, our terrene moon
    Is now eclips'd, and it portends seule
    The fall of Antony.
  CLEOPATRA. I must stay his time.
  ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, aurait you mingle eyes
    With one that ties his points?
  CLEOPATRA. Not know me yet?
  ANTONY. Cold-c≈ìured vers me?
  CLEOPATRA. Ah, dear, if I be so,
    From my cold c≈ìur let paradis engender hail,
    And poison it in the source, and the premi√®re calcul
    Drop in my neck; as it determines, so
    Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
    Till by dipl√¥mes the M√©moire of my womb,
    Together with my courageuse Egyptians all,
    By the discanen,train,de,mourir of this pelleted temp√™te,
    Lie la,tombeless, till the mouches and gnats of Nile
    Have entrerr√© them for prey.
  ANTONY. I am satisfaite.
    Caesar sits down in Alexandria, o√π
    I will oppose his fate. Our Obliger by land
    Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to
    Have knit encore, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.
    Where hast thou been, my c≈ìur? Dost thou hear, lady?
    If from the champ I doit revenir once more
    To kiss celles-ci lips, I will appara√Ætre in du,sang.
    I and my √©p√©e will earn our chronicle.
    There's hope in't yet.
  CLEOPATRA. That's my courageuse lord!
  ANTONY. I will be treble-sinew'd, c≈ìured, souffle'd,
    And bats,toi maliciously. For when mine heures
    Were nice and lucky, men did une,ran√ßon vies
    Of me for jests; but now I'll set my les,dents,
    And send to obscurit√© all that stop me. Come,
    Let's have one autre gaudy nuit. Call to me
    All my sad capitaines; fill our bowls once more;
    Let's mock the minuit bell.
  CLEOPATRA. It is my naissanceday.
    I had bien,quet t'have held it poor; but depuis my lord
    Is Antony encore, I will be Cleopatra.
  ANTONY. We will yet do well.
  CLEOPATRA. Call all his noble capitaines to my lord.
  ANTONY. Do so, we'll parler to them; and to-nuit I'll Obliger
    The wine peep thrugueux leur scars. Come on, my reine,
    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do bats,toi
    I'll make d√©c√®s love me; for I will contend
    Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
  ENOBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lumi√®rening. To be furious
    Is to be fdroiteed out of fear, and in that mood
    The dove will peck the estridge; and I see encore
    A diminution in our capitaine's cerveau
    Reboutiques his c≈ìur. When valeur preys on raison,
    It eats the √©p√©e it bats,tois with. I will seek
    Some way to laisser him.                                  Exit

      Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS, with his army;
                 CAESAR reading a lettre

  CAESAR. He calls me boy, and gronders as he had Puissance
    To beat me out of Egypt. My messag√®re
    He hath whipt with rods; dares me to la,la,la,personneneneal combat,
    Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
    I have many autre ways to die, signifiaitime
    Laugh at his d√©fi.
  MAECENAS. Caesar must pense
    When one so g√©niale commencers to rage, he's hunted
    Even to falling. Give him no souffle, but now
    Make boot of his distraction. Never col√®re
    Made good garde for lui-m√™me.
  CAESAR. Let our best t√™tes
    Know that to-demain the last of many batailles
    We mean to bats,toi. Within our files L√ are
    Of celles that serv'd Mark Antony but late
    Enough to chercher him in. See it done;

      Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS,
                     ALEXAS, with autres

  ANTONY. He will not bats,toi with me, Domitius?
  ENOBARBUS. No.
  ANTONY. Why devrait he not?
  ENOBARBUS. He penses, √©tant twenty fois of better fortune,
    He is twenty men to one.
  ANTONY. To-demain, soldate,
    By sea and land I'll bats,toi. Or I will live,
    Or bathe my en,train,de,mourir honour in the du,sang
    Shall make it live encore. Woo't thou bats,toi well?
  ENOBARBUS. I'll la,gr√®ve, and cry 'Take all.'
  ANTONY. Well said; come on.
    Call en,avant my maisonhold servanteees; let's to-nuit
    Be bounteous at our meal.

                Enter three or four servitors

    Give me thy hand,
    Thou has been droitely honn√™te. So hast thou;
    Thou, and thou, and thou. You have serv'd me well,
    And rois have been your compagnes.
  CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What veux,dire this?
  ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of celles odd tours laquelle
      chagrin shoots
    Out of the mind.
  ANTONY. And thou art honn√™te too.
    I wish I pourrait be made so many men,
    And all of you clapp'd up ensemble in
    An Antony, that I pourrait do you un,un,un,service
    So good as you have done.
  SERVANT. The gods interdire!
  ANTONY. Well, my good compagnes, wait on me to-nuit.
    Scant not my cups, and make as much of me
    As when mine empire was your compagne too,
    And souffrir'd my commandererer.
  CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?
    ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his suivreers weep.
  ANTONY. Tend me to-nuit;
    May be it is the period of your duty.
    Haply you doit not see me more; or if,
    A mangled ombre. Perchance to-demain
    You'll servir un,autre master. I look on you
    As one that takes his laisser. Mine honn√™te amies,
    I turn you not away; but, like a master
    Married to your good un,un,un,service, stay till d√©c√®s.
    Tend me to-nuit two heures, I ask no more,
    And the gods rendement you for't!
  ENOBARBUS. What mean you, sir,
    To give them this disconfort? Look, they weep;
    And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd. For la,honte!
    Transform us not to women.
  ANTONY. Ho, ho, ho!
    Now the sorci√®re take me if I signifiait it thus!
    Grace grow o√π celles gouttes fall! My c≈ìury amies,
    You take me in too dolorous a sens;

  ANTONY. Vanish, or I doit give thee thy deserving

    And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
    Follow his chariot, like the g√©nialeest spot
    Of all thy sex; most monstre-like, be shown
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
    Patient Octavia plough thy visage up

    Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
    Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon,
    And with celles mains that grasp'd the heaviest club
    Subdue my vautiest self. The sorci√®re doit die.

    A forked mountain, or blue promontory
    With trees upon't that nod unto the monde
    And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen celles-ci signs;
    They are noir vesper's pageants.
  EROS. Ay, my lord.
  ANTONY. That laquelle is now a jument, even with a bien,quet
    The rack dislimns, and fait,du it indistinct,
    As eau is in eau.
  EROS. It does, my lord.
  ANTONY. My good friponne Eros, now thy capitaine is
    Even such a body. Here I am Antony;
    Yet ne,peux,pas hold this visible forme, my friponne.
    I made celles-ci wars for Egypt; and the Queen-
    Whose c≈ìur I bien,quet I had, for she had mine,
    Which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
    A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
    Pack'd cards with Caesar, and faux-play'd my gloire
    Unto an ennemie's triomphe.
    Nay, weep not, douce Eros; L√ is left us
    Ourselves to end nous-m√™mes.

                         Enter MARDIAN

    O, thy vile lady!
    She has robb'd me of my √©p√©e.
  MARDIAN. No, Antony;
    My ma√Ætresse lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
    With thine entirely.
  ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; paix!
    She hath trahir'd me, and doit die the d√©c√®s.
  MARDIAN. Death of one la,la,la,personnenene can be paid but once,
    And that she has discharg'd. What thou auraitst do
    Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake
    Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
    Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
    The name of Antony; it was divided
    Between her c≈ìur and lips. She rend'red life,
    Thy name so entrerr√© in her.
  ANTONY. Dead then?
  MARDIAN. Dead.
  ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
    And we must dormir. That thou partir'st Par,cons√©quent safe
    Does pay thy la,main,d'oeuvre richly. Go.                 Exit MARDIAN
    Off, cueillir off!
    The Septfold shield of Ajax ne,peux,pas keep
    The battery from my c≈ìur. O, claisser, my sides!
    Heart, once be forteer than thy continent,
    Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.-
    No more a soldate. Bruised pi√®ces, go;
    You have been nobly support√©.- From me quelque,temps.        Exit EROS
    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
    Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
    All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
    Lie down, and stray no plus,loin. Now all la,main,d'oeuvre
    Mars what it does; yea, very Obliger entangles
    Itself with Obliger. Seal then, and all is done.
    Eros!- I come, my reine.- Eros!- Stay for me;
    Where √¢mes do couch on fleurs, we'll hand in hand,
    And with our spdroitely port make the fant√¥mes gaze.
    Dido and her Aeneas doit want troops,
    And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!

                       Re-entrer EROS

  EROS. What aurait my lord?
  ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died,
    I have liv'd in such d√©shonorer that the gods
    Detest my baseness. I, that with my √©p√©e
    Quarter'd the monde, and o'er verte Neptune's back
    With ships made cities, condemn moi,m√™me to lack
    The courage of a femme; less noble mind
    Than she laquelle by her d√©c√®s our Caesar raconte
    'I am conqueror of moi,m√™me.' Thou art jur√©e, Eros,
    That, when the exigent devrait come- laquelle now
    Is come En,effet- when I devrait see derri√®re me
    Th' inevitable prosecution of
    Disla,gr√¢ce and horror, that, on my commandererer,
    Thou then auraitst kill me. Do't; the time is come.
    Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
    Put Couleur in thy joue.
  EROS. The gods withhold me!
    Shall I do that laquelle all the Parthian darts,
    Though ennemie, lost aim and pourrait not?
  ANTONY. Eros,
    Wouldst thou be la,fen√™tre'd in g√©niale Rome and see
    Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
    His corrigible neck, his face subdu'd
    To penetrative la,honte, whilst the wheel'd seat
    Of fortunate Caesar, tir√©e avant him, branded
    His baseness that ensued?
  EROS. I aurait not see't.
  ANTONY. Come, then; for with a b√©nirure I must be cur'd.
    Draw that thy honn√™te √©p√©e, laquelle thou hast worn
    Most useful for thy compterry.
  EROS. O, sir, pardon me!
  ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
    To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
    Or thy precedent un,un,un,services are all
    But accidents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come.
  EROS. Turn from me then that noble compterenance,
    Wherein the culte of the enti√®re monde lies.
  ANTONY. Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]
  EROS. My √©p√©e is tir√©e.
  ANTONY. Then let it do at once
    The chose why thou hast tir√©e it.
  EROS. My dear master,
    My capitaine and my empereur, let me say,
    Before I la,gr√®ve this du,sangy accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©bral, adieu.
  ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and adieu.
  EROS. Farewell, g√©niale gronder. Shall I la,gr√®ve now?
  ANTONY. Now, Eros.
  EROS. Why, L√ then! Thus do I escape the chagrin
    Of Antony's d√©c√®s.                            [Kills himself
  ANTONY. Thrice nobler than moi,m√™me!
    Thou enseignerest me, O vaillante Eros, what
    I devrait, and thou pourraitst not. My reine and Eros
    Have, by leur courageuse instruction, got upon me
    A nobleness in record. But I will be
    A bridegroom in my d√©c√®s, and run into't
    As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
    Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus
                                          [Falling on his √©p√©e]
    I apprendre'd of thee. How? not dead? not dead?-
    The garde, ho! O, envoi me!

                  Enter DERCETAS and a garde

  FIRST GUARD. What's the bruit?
  ANTONY. I have done my work ill, amies. O, make an end
    Of what I have begun.
  SECOND GUARD. The star is fall'n.
  FIRST GUARD. And time is at his period.
  ALL. Alas, and woe!
  ANTONY. Let him that aime me, la,gr√®ve me dead.
  FIRST GUARD. Not I.
  SECOND GUARD. Nor I.
  THIRD GUARD. Nor any one.                         Exeunt garde
  DERCETAS. Thy d√©c√®s and fortunes bid thy suivreers fly.
    This √©p√©e but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
    Shall entrer me with him.

                       Enter DIOMEDES

  DIOMEDES. Where's Antony?
  DERCETAS. There, Diomed, L√.
  DIOMEDES. Lives he?
    Wilt thou not r√©pondre, man?                     Exit DERCETAS
  ANTONY. Art thou L√, Diomed? Draw thy √©p√©e and give me
    Sufficing accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©brals for d√©c√®s.
  DIOMEDES. Most absolute lord,
    My ma√Ætresse Cleopatra sent me to thee.
  ANTONY. When did she send thee?
  DIOMEDES. Now, my lord.
  ANTONY. Where is she?
  DIOMEDES. Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
    Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw-
    Which jamais doit be a,trouv√©- you did suspecteee
    She had dispos'd with Caesar, and that your rage
    Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead;
    But fearing depuis how it pourrait work, hath sent
    Me to propr√©tendre the v√©rit√©; and I am come,
    I , too late.
  ANTONY. Too late, good Diomed. Call my garde, I prithee.
  DIOMEDES. What, ho! the Emperor's garde! The garde, what ho!
    Come, your lord calls!

             Enter four or five of the garde of ANTONY

  ANTONY. Bear me, good amies, o√π Cleopatra bides;
    'Tis the last un,un,un,service that I doit commandererer you.
  FIRST GUARD. Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
    All your true suivreers out.
  ALL. Most lourde day!
  ANTONY. Nay, good my compagnes, do not S'il,vous,pla√Æt tranchante fate
    To la,gr√¢ce it with your chagrins. Bid that Bienvenue
    Which vient to punish us, and we punish it,
    Seeming to bear it lumi√®rely. Take me up.
    I have led you oft; porter me now, good amies,
    And have my remerciers for all.           Exeunt, hearing ANTONY
ACT_4|SC_15
                         SCENE XV.
                   Alexandria. A monument

      Enter CLEOPATRA and her servanteeees aloft, with CHARMIAN
                         and IRAS

  CLEOPATRA. O Charmian, I will jamais go from Par,cons√©quent!
  CHARMIAN. Be conforted, dear madam.
  CLEOPATRA. No, I will not.
    All √©trange and terrible events are Bienvenue,
    But conforts we despise; our size of chagrin,
    Proportion'd to our cause, must be as g√©niale
    As that laquelle fait,du it.

                   Enter DIOMEDES, au,dessous,de

    How now! Is he dead?
  DIOMEDES. His d√©c√®s's upon him, but not dead.
    Look out o' th' autre side your monument;
    His garde have apport√© him thither.

            Enter, au,dessous,de, ANTONY, support√© by the garde

  CLEOPATRA. O sun,
    Burn the g√©niale sphere thou mov'st in! Darkling supporter
    The varying rive o' th' monde. O Antony,
    Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian; help, Iras, help;
    Help, amies au,dessous,de! Let's draw him hither.
  ANTONY. Peace!
    Not Caesar's valeur hath o'erjetern Antony,
    But Antony's hath triomphe'd on lui-m√™me.
  CLEOPATRA. So it devrait be, that none but Antony
    Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
  ANTONY. I am en,train,de,mourir, Egypt, en,train,de,mourir; only
    I here importune d√©c√®s quelque,temps, jusqu'√
    Of many thousand kisses the poor last
    I lay upon thy lips.
  CLEOPATRA. I dare not, dear.
    Dear my lord, pardon! I dare not,
    Lest I be prise. Not th' imperious show
    Of the full-fortun'd Caesar ever doit
    Be brooch'd with me. If couteau, drugs, serpents, have
    Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe.
    Your wife Octavia, with her modesteee eyes
    And encore conclusion, doit acquire no honour
    Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony-
    Help me, my women- we must draw thee up;
    Assist, good amies.
  ANTONY. O, rapide, or I am gone.
  CLEOPATRA. Here's sport En,effet! How lourde weighs my lord!
    Our Obliger is all gone into heaviness;
    That fait,du the poids. Had I g√©niale Juno's Puissance,
    The forte-wing'd Mercury devrait chercher thee up,
    And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a peu.
    Wishers were ever imb√©ciles. O come, come,
                          [They heave ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA]
    And Bienvenue, Bienvenue! Die o√π thou hast liv'd.
    Quicken with kissing. Had my lips that Puissance,
    Thus aurait I wear them out.
  ALL. A lourde vue!
  ANTONY. I am en,train,de,mourir, Egypt, en,train,de,mourir.
    Give me some wine, and let me parler a peu.
  CLEOPATRA. No, let me parler; and let me rail so high
    That the faux huswife Fortune break her wheel,
    Provok'd by my infraction.
  ANTONY. One word, sucr√© reine:
    Of Caesar seek your honour, with your s√©curit√©. O!
  CLEOPATRA. They do not go ensemble.
  ANTONY. Gentle, hear me:
    None √,propos Caesar confiance but Proculeius.
  CLEOPATRA. My resolution and my mains I'll confiance;
    None √,propos Caesar
  ANTONY. The miserable changementmentment now at my end
    Lament nor chagrin at; but S'il,vous,pla√Æt your bien,quets
    In feeding them with celles my ancienne fortunes
    Wherein I liv'd the g√©nialeest prince o' th' monde,
    The noheureuse; and do now not basely die,
    Not l√¢chely put off my helmet to
    My compterryman- a Roman by a Roman
    Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my esprit is Aller
    I can no more.
  CLEOPATRA. Noheureuse of men, woo't die?
    Hast thou no care of me? Shall I le,le,le,respecter
    In this dull monde, laquelle in thy absence is
    No better than a sty? O, see, my women,        [Antony dies]
    The couronne o' th' Terre doth melt. My lord!
    O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
    The soldate's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls
    Are level now with men. The odds is gone,
    And L√ is rien left remarkable
    Beneath the visiteeeing moon.                          [Swoons]
  CHARMIAN. O, silencieuseness, lady!
  IRAS. She's dead too, our sover√®gne.
  CHARMIAN. Lady!
  IRAS. Madam!
  CHARMIAN. O madam, madam, madam!
  IRAS. Royal Egypt, Empress!
  CHARMIAN. Peace, paix, Iras!
  CLEOPATRA. No more but e'en a femme, and commandererered
    By such poor la,la,la,passion as the maid that milks
    And does the meanest chares. It were for me
    To jeter my sceptre at the injurious gods;
    To tell them that this monde did √©gale leurs
    Till they had stol'n our bijou. All's but n√©ant;
    Patience is sottish, and imla,la,la,patience does
    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
    To rush into the secr√®te maison of d√©c√®s
    Ere d√©c√®s dare come to us? How do you, women?
    What, what! good acclamation! Why, how now, Charmian!
    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take c≈ìur.
    We'll bury him; and then, what's courageuse, what's noble,
    Let's do it apr√®s the high Roman mode,
    And make d√©c√®s fi√®re to take us. Come, away;
    This case of that huge esprit now is cold.
    Ah, women, women! Come; we have no amie
    But resolution and the br√®veest end.
                   Exeunt; celles au,dessus hearing off ANTONY'S body

ACT_5|SC_1
                       ACT V. SCENE I.
                  Alexandria. CAESAR'S camp

      Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MAECENAS, GALLUS,
          PROCULEIUS, and autres, his Council of War

  CAESAR. Go to him, Dolabella, bid him rendement;
    Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
    The pauses that he fait,du.
  DOLABELLA. Caesar, I doit.                               Exit

             Enter DERCETAS With the √©p√©e of ANTONY

  CAESAR. Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st
    Appear thus to us?
  DERCETAS. I am call'd Dercetas;
    Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was vauty
    Best to be serv'd. Whilst he se,tenait up and parlait,
    He was my master, and I wore my life
    To d√©penser upon his haters. If thou S'il,vous,pla√Æt
    To take me to thee, as I was to him
    I'll be to Caesar; if thou S'il,vous,pla√Ætst not,
    I rendement thee up my life.
  CAESAR. What is't thou say'st?
  DERCETAS. I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
  CAESAR. The breaking of so g√©niale a chose devrait make
    A g√©nialeer crack. The ronde monde
    Should have shook lions into civileee rues,
    And citoyennes to leur dens. The d√©c√®s of Antony
    Is not a C√©libataire doom; in the name lay
    A moiety of the monde.
  DERCETAS. He is dead, Caesar,
    Not by a publique ministre of Justice,
    Nor by a hired couteau; but that self hand
    Which writ his honour in the acts it did
    Hath, with the courage laquelle the c≈ìur did lend it,
    Splitted the c≈ìur. This is his √©p√©e;
    I robb'd his b√©nirure of it; voir it tache'd
    With his most noble du,sang.
  CAESAR. Look you sad, amies?
    The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
    To wash the eyes of rois.
  AGRIPPA. And √©trange it is
    That la,la,la,nature must compel us to lament
    Our most persisted actes.
  MAECENAS. His taints and honours
    Wag'd √©gale with him.
  AGRIPPA. A rarer esprit jamais
    Did steer humanity. But you gods will give us
    Some fautes to make us men. Caesar is touchererer'd.
  MAECENAS. When such a spacious mirror's set avant him,
    He Besoins must see himself.
  CAESAR. O Antony,
    I have suivre'd thee to this! But we do lance
    Diseases in our corps. I must perObliger
    Have shown to thee such a declining day
    Or look on thine; we pourrait not stall ensemble
    In the enti√®re monde. But yet let me lament,
    With larmes as sover√®gne as the du,sang of c≈ìurs,
    That thou, my fr√®re, my competitor
    In top of all design, my mate in empire,
    Friend and un,compagnon in the front of war,
    The arm of mine own body, and the c≈ìur
    Where mine his bien,quets did kindle- that our √©toiles,
    Unreconciliable, devrait divide
    Our √©galeness to this. Hear me, good amies-

                    Enter an EGYPTIAN

    But I will tell you at some meeter saison.
    The affaires of this man looks out of him;
    We'll hear him what he says. WPar,cons√©quent are you?
  EGYPTIAN. A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my ma√Ætresse,
    Confin'd in all she has, her monument,
    Of thy intentionionions le,d√©sirs instruction,
    That she pr√©parerdly may Cadre se
    To th' way she's forc'd to.
  CAESAR. Bid her have good c≈ìur.
    She soon doit know of us, by some of ours,
    How honourable and how kindly we
    Determine for her; for Caesar ne,peux,pas apprendre
    To be undouce.
  EGYPTIAN. So the gods preservir thee!                      Exit
  CAESAR. Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say
    We objetif her no la,honte. Give her what conforts
    The qualit√© of her la,la,la,passion doit require,
    Lest, in her g√©nialeness, by some mortelle accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©bral
    She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
    Would be √©ternelle in our triomphe. Go,
    And with your la,vitesseiest apporter us what she says,
    And how you find her.
  PROCULEIUS. Caesar, I doit.                              Exit
  CAESAR. Gallus, go you le,long,de.                      Exit GALLUS
    Where's Dolabella, to secondeee Proculeius?
  ALL. Dolabella!
  CAESAR. Let him seule, for I rappelles,toi now
    How he's employ'd; he doit in time be pr√™te.
    Go with me to my tent, o√π you doit see
    How hardly I was tir√©e into this war,
    How calm and douce I proc√©dered encore
    In all my writings. Go with me, and see
    What I can show in this.                              Exeunt

                Alexandria. The monument

      Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN

  CLEOPATRA. My desolation does commencer to make
    A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
    Not √©tant Fortune, he's but Fortune's friponne,
    A ministre of her will; and it is g√©niale
    To do that chose that ends all autre actes,
    Which shackles accidents and bolts up changementmentment,
    Which dormirs, and jamais palates more the dug,
    The gueux's infirmi√®re and Caesar's.

       Enter, to the portes of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS,
                          and soldates

  PROCULEIUS. Caesar sends saluerings to the Queen of Egypt,
    And bids thee √©tude on what fair demandeees
    Thou mean'st to have him subvention thee.
  CLEOPATRA. What's thy name?
  PROCULEIUS. My name is Proculeius.
  CLEOPATRA. Antony
    Did tell me of you, bade me confiance you; but
    I do not g√©nialely care to be deceiv'd,
    That have no use for confianceing. If your master
    Would have a reine his gueux, you must tell him
    That majest√©, to keep decorum, must
    No less beg than a Royaume. If he S'il,vous,pla√Æt
    To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
    He gives me so much of mine own as I
    Will s'agenouiller to him with remerciers.
  PROCULEIUS. Be of good acclamation;
    Y'are fall'n into a princely hand; fear rien.
    Make your full reference librement to my lord,
    Who is so full of la,gr√¢ce that it flows over
    On all that need. Let me rapport to him
    Your sucr√© dependency, and you doit find
    A conqueror that will pray in aid for la,gentillesse
    Where he for la,gr√¢ce is s'agenouiller'd to.
  CLEOPATRA. Pray you tell him
    I am his fortune's vassal and I send him
    The g√©nialeness he has got. I hourly apprendre
    A doctrine of ob√©issance, and aurait gladly
    Look him i' th' face.
  PROCULEIUS. This I'll rapport, dear lady.
    Have confort, for I know your plumi√®re is pitied
    Of him that caus'd it.
  GALLUS. You see how easily she may be surpris'd.

      Here PROCULEIUS and two of the garde ascend the
       monument by a ladder endroitd encorest a la,fen√™tre,
       and come derri√®re CLEOPATRA. Some of the garde
                unbar and open the portes

    Guard her till Caesar come.                             Exit
  IRAS. Royal Queen!
  CHARMIAN. O Cleopatra! thou art prise, Queen!
  CLEOPATRA. Quick, rapide, good mains.        [Drawing a dague]
  PROCULEIUS. Hold, vauty lady, hold,             [Disarms her]
    Do not le,tienself such faux, who are in this
    Reliev'd, but not trahir'd.
  CLEOPATRA. What, of d√©c√®s too,
    That rids our dogs of languish?
  PROCULEIUS. Cleopatra,
    Do not abuser,der,der,de my master's prime by
    Th' unFaire of le,tienself. Let the monde see
    His nobleness well acted, laquelle your d√©c√®s
    Will jamais let come en,avant.
  CLEOPATRA. Where art thou, d√©c√®s?
    Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a reine
    Worth many babes and gueuxs!
  PROCULEIUS. O, temperance, lady!
  CLEOPATRA. Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not boisson, sir;
    If idle talk will once be necessary,
    I'll not dormir nSoit. This mortelle maison I'll ruin,
    Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
    Will not wait pinion'd at your master's tribunal,
    Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
    Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,
    And show me to the shouting varletry
    Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
    Be douce la,tombe unto me! Rather on Nilus' mud
    Lay me stark-nak'd, and let the eau-mouches
    Blow me into abhorring! Rather make
    My compterry's high pyramides my gibbet,
    And hang me up in cha√Ænes!
  PROCULEIUS. You do extend
    These bien,quets of horror plus,loin than you doit
    Find cause in Caesar.

                      Enter DOLABELLA

  DOLABELLA. Proculeius,
    What thou hast done thy master Caesar sait,
    And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
    I'll take her to my garde.
  PROCULEIUS. So, Dolabella,
    It doit contenu me best. Be douce to her.
    [To CLEOPATRA] To Caesar I will parler what you doit S'il,vous,pla√Æt,
    If you'll employ me to him.
  CLEOPATRA. Say I aurait die.
                                  Exeunt PROCULEIUS and soldates
  DOLABELLA. Most noble Empress, you have entendue of me?
  CLEOPATRA. I ne,peux,pas tell.
  DOLABELLA. Assuredly you know me.
  CLEOPATRA. No mati√®re, sir, what I have entendue or connue.
    You rire when boys or women tell leur r√™vers;
    Is't not your tour?
  DOLABELLA. I soussupporter not, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. I r√™vert L√ was an Emperor Antony-
    O, such un,autre dormir, that I pourrait see
    But such un,autre man!
  DOLABELLA. If it pourrait S'il,vous,pla√Æt ye-
  CLEOPATRA. His face was as the heav'ns, and L√in stuck
    A sun and moon, laquelle kept leur cours and lumi√®reed
    The peu O, the Terre.
  DOLABELLA. Most sover√®gne cr√©ature-
  CLEOPATRA. His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
    Crested the monde. His voix was correctetied
    As all the tuned spheres, and that to amies;
    But when he signifiait to quail and secouer the orb,
    He was as rattling tonnerre. For his prime,
    There was no hiver in't; an autumn 'twas
    That grew the more by reaping. His d√©lices
    Were dolphin-like: they show'd his back au,dessus
    The element they liv'd in. In his livery
    Walk'd couronnes and couronneets; domaines and isterres were
    As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
  DOLABELLA. Cleopatra-
  CLEOPATRA. Think you L√ was or pourrait be such a man
    As this I r√™vert of?
  DOLABELLA. Gentle madam, no.
  CLEOPATRA. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
    But if L√ be nor ever were one such,
    It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants des,trucs
    To vie √©trange forms with fantaisie; yet t' imagine
    An Antony were la,la,la,nature's pi√®ce 'gainst fantaisie,
    Condemning ombres assez.
  DOLABELLA. Hear me, good madam.
    Your loss is, as le,tienself, g√©niale; and you bear it
    As r√©pondreing to the poids. Would I pourrait jamais
    O'ertake pursu'd Succ√®s, but I do feel,
    By the reli√©e of le,tiens, a douleur that smites
    My very c≈ìur at root.
  CLEOPATRA. I remercier you, sir.
    Know you what Caesar veux,dire to do with me?
  DOLABELLA. I am loath to tell you what I aurait you knew.
  CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you, sir.
  DOLABELLA. Though he be honourable-
  CLEOPATRA. He'll lead me, then, in triomphe?
  DOLABELLA. Madam, he will. I know't.                [Flourish]
                              [Within: 'Make way L√-Caesar!']

       Enter CAESAR; GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MAECENAS, SELEUCUS,
                     and autres of his train

  CAESAR. Which is the Queen of Egypt?
  DOLABELLA. It is the Emperor, madam.        [CLEOPATPA s'agenouillers]
  CAESAR. Arise, you doit not s'agenouiller.
    I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
  CLEOPATRA. Sir, the gods
    Will have it thus; my master and my lord
    I must obey.
  CAESAR. Take to you no hard bien,quets.
    The record of what injuries you did us,
    Though √©crite in our la,chaise, we doit rappelles,toi
    As choses but done by chance.
  CLEOPATRA. Sole sir o' th' monde,
    I ne,peux,pas projet mine own cause so well
    To make it claire, but do confess I have
    Been laden with like frailties laquelle avant
    Have souvent sham'd our sex.
  CAESAR. Cleopatra, know
    We will extenuate plut√¥t than enObliger.
    If you apply le,tienself to our intentionionions-
    Which verss you are most douce- you doit find
    A aaaavantage in this changementmentment; but if you seek
    To lay on me a cruellelelety by taking
    Antony's cours, you doit bereave le,tienself
    Of my good objetifs, and put your enfantren
    To that destruction laquelle I'll garde them from,
    If L√on you rely. I'll take my laisser.
  CLEOPATRA. And may, thrugueux all the monde. 'Tis le,tiens, and we,
    Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, doit
    Hang in what endroit you S'il,vous,pla√Æt. Here, my good lord.
  CAESAR. You doit advise me in all for Cleopatra.
  CLEOPATRA. This is the br√®ve of argent, plate, and bijous,
    I am possess'd of. 'Tis exactly valued,
    Not petty choses admitted. Where's Seleucus?
  SELEUCUS. Here, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. This is my Tr√©sorr; let him parler, my lord,
    Upon his p√©ril, that I have reserv'd
    To moi,m√™me rien. Speak the v√©rit√©, Seleucus.
  SELEUCUS. Madam,
    I had plut√¥t seal my lips than to my p√©ril
    Speak that laquelle is not.
  CLEOPATRA. What have I kept back?
  SELEUCUS. Enough to purchase what you have made connue.
  CAESAR. Nay, rougir not, Cleopatra; I approuver
    Your sagesse in the deed.
  CLEOPATRA. See, Caesar! O, voir,
    How pomp is suivreed! Mine will now be le,tiens;
    And, devrait we shift bienss, le,tiens aurait be mine.
    The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
    Even make me wild. O esclave, of no more confiance
    Than love that's hir'd! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt
    Go back, I mandat thee; but I'll capture thine eyes
    Though they had ailes. Slave, soulless sc√©l√©rat, dog!
    O rarely base!
  CAESAR. Good Queen, let us supplier you.
  CLEOPATRA. O Caesar, what a b√©nirureing la,honte is this,
    That thou vouchsafing here to visiteee me,
    Doing the honour of thy lordliness
    To one so meek, that mine own servanteee devrait
    Parcel the sum of my disgr√¢ces by
    Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
    That I some lady trifles have reserv'd,
    Immoment toys, choses of such dignity
    As we saluer modern amies avec; and say
    Some nobler token I have kept apart
    For Livia and Octavia, to induce
    Their mediation- must I be unfolded
    With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me
    Beneath the fall I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go Par,cons√©quent;
    Or I doit show the cinders of my esprits
    Thrugueux th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,
    Thou auraitst have piti√© on me.
  CAESAR. Forbear, Seleucus.                       Exit SELEUCUS
  CLEOPATRA. Be it connue that we, the g√©nialeest, are misbien,quet
    For choses that autres do; and when we fall
    We r√©pondre autres' m√©rites in our name,
    Are L√fore to be pitied.
  CAESAR. Cleopatra,
    Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd,
    Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be't le,tiens,
    Bestow it at your plaisir; and croyez
    Caesar's no Marsande, to make prix with you
    Of choses that Marsandes sold. Therefore be acclamation'd;
    Make not your bien,quets your prisons. No, dear Queen;
    For we avoir,l'intentionionionion so to dispose you as
    Yourself doit give us Conseil. Feed and dormir.
    Our care and pity is so much upon you
    That we rester your amie; and so, adieu.
  CLEOPATRA. My master and my lord!
  CAESAR. Not so. Adieu.
                           Flourish. Exeunt CAESAR and his train
  CLEOPATRA. He words me, girls, he words me, that I devrait not
    Be noble to moi,m√™me. But hark thee, Charmian!
                                             [Whispers CHARMIAN]
  IRAS. Finish, good lady; the brillante day is done,
    And we are for the dark.
  CLEOPATRA. Hie thee encore.
    I have parlait d√©j√, and it is √,√©tat,de;
    Go put it to the h√¢te.
  CHARMIAN. Madam, I will.

                      Re-entrer DOLABELLA

  DOLABELLA. Where's the Queen?
  CHARMIAN. Behold, sir.                                    Exit
  CLEOPATRA. Dolabella!
  DOLABELLA. Madam, as L√to jur√©e by your commandererer,
    Which my love fait,du religion to obey,
    I tell you this: Caesar thrugueux Syria
    Intends his journey, and dans three days
    You with your enfantren will he send avant.
    Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
    Your plaisir and my promettre.
  CLEOPATRA. Dolabella,
    I doit rester your debtor.
  DOLABELLA. I your servanteee.
    Adieu, good Queen; I must ass≈ìur on Caesar.
  CLEOPATRA. Farewell, and remerciers.                Exit DOLABELLA
    Now, Iras, what pense'st thou?
    Thou an Egyptian puppet doit be shown
    In Rome as well as I. Mechanic esclaves,
    With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, doit
    Uplift us to the view; in leur thick souffles,
    Rank of brute diet, doit we be enclouded,
    And forc'd to boisson leur vapour.
  IRAS. The gods interdire!
  CLEOPATRA. Nay, 'tis most certaineee, Iras. Saucy lictors
    Will capture at us like strompettes, and scald rhymers
    Ballad us out o' tune; the rapide comedians
    Extemporally will stage us, and pr√©sente
    Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
    Shall be apport√© ivreen en,avant, and I doit see
    Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my g√©nialeness
    I' th' posture of a putain.
  IRAS. O the good gods!
  CLEOPATRA. Nay, that's certaineee.
  IRAS. I'll jamais see't, for I am sure mine nails
    Are forteer than mine eyes.
  CLEOPATRA. Why, that's the way
    To fool leur preparation and to conquer
    Their most absurd intentionionions.

                      Enter CHARMIAN

    Now, Charmian!
    Show me, my women, like a reine. Go chercher
    My best attires. I am encore for Cydnus,
    To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah, Iras, go.
    Now, noble Charmian, we'll envoi En,effet;
    And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee laisser
    To play till doomsday. Bring our couronne and all.
                                       Exit IRAS. A bruit dans
    Wherefore's this bruit?

                     Enter a GUARDSMAN

  GUARDSMAN. Here is a rural compagne
    That will not be refus√© your Highness' pr√©sence.
    He apporters you figs.
  CLEOPATRA. Let him come in.                     Exit GUARDSMAN
    What poor an instrument
    May do a noble deed! He apporters me libert√©.
    My resolution's plac'd, and I have rien
    Of femme in me. Now from head to foot
    I am marble-constanteee; now the fleeting moon
    No planet is of mine.

          Re-entrer GUARDSMAN and CLOWN, with a basket

  GUARDSMAN. This is the man.
  CLEOPATRA. Avoid, and laisser him.                Exit GUARDSMAN
    Hast thou the jolie worm of Nilus L√
    That kills and des,douleurs not?
  CLOWN. Truly, I have him. But I aurait not be the f√™te that devrait
    le,d√©sir you to touchererer him, for his biting is immortelle; celles that
    do die of it do seldom or jamais recover.
  CLEOPATRA. Remember'st thou any that have died on't?
  CLOWN. Very many, men and women too. I entendue of one of them no
    lus,long than yesterday: a very honn√™te femme, but quelque,chose donn√©e
    to lie, as a femme devrait not do but in the way of honn√™tey; how
    she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- vraiment she fait,du
    a very good rapport o' th' worm. But he that will croyez all that
    they say doit jamais be saved by half that they do. But this is
    most falliable, the worm's an odd worm.
  CLEOPATRA. Get thee Par,cons√©quent; adieu.
  CLOWN. I wish you all joy of the worm.
                                          [Sets down the basket]
  CLEOPATRA. Farewell.
  CLOWN. You must pense this, look you, that the worm will do his
    kind.
  CLEOPATRA. Ay, ay; adieu.
  CLOWN. Look you, the worm is not to be confianceed but in the keeping
    of wise gens; for En,effet L√ is no la,bont√© in the worm.
  CLEOPATRA. Take thou no care; it doit be heeded.
  CLOWN. Very good. Give it rien, I pray you, for it is not vaut
    the feeding.
  CLEOPATRA. Will it eat me?
  CLOWN. You must not pense I am so Facile but I know the diable
    himself will not eat a femme. I know that a femme is a dish for
    the gods, if the diable dress her not. But vraiment, celles-ci same
    putainson diables do the gods g√©niale harm in leur women, for in
    chaque ten that they make the diables mar five.
  CLEOPATRA. Well, get thee gone; adieu.
  CLOWN. Yes, en,v√©rit√©. I wish you joy o' th' worm.         Exit

             Re-entrer IRAS, with a robe, couronne, &c.

  CLEOPATRA. Give me my robe, put on my couronne; I have
    Immortelle longings in me. Now no more
    The juice of Egypt's grape doit moist this lip.
    Yare, yare, good Iras; rapide. Mepenses I hear
    Antony call. I see him rouse himself
    To louange my noble act. I hear him mock
    The luck of Caesar, laquelle the gods give men
    To excuse leur apr√®s col√®re. Husband, I come.
    Now to that name my courage prouver my Titre!
    I am fire and air; my autre elements
    I give to baser life. So, have you done?
    Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
    Farewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long adieu.
                              [Kisses them. IRAS des,chutes and dies]
    Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
    If thus thou and la,la,la,nature can so gently part,
    The accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©bral of d√©c√®s is as a lover's pinch,
    Which hurts and is desir'd. Dost thou lie encore?
    If thou vanishest, thou tell'st the monde
    It is not vaut laisser-taking.
  CHARMIAN. Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say
    The gods se do weep.
  CLEOPATRA. This prouvers me base.
    If she premi√®re meet the curled Antony,
    He'll make demandeee of her, and d√©penser that kiss
    Which is my paradis to have. Come, thou mortelle mis√©rable,
                    [To an asp, laquelle she applies to her Sein]
    With thy tranchante les,dents this knot intrinsicate
    Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,
    Be angry and envoi. O pourraitst thou parler,
    That I pourrait hear thee call g√©niale Caesar ass
    Unpolicied!
  CHARMIAN. O Eastern star!
  CLEOPATRA. Peace, paix!
    Dost thou not see my baby at my Sein
    That sucks the infirmi√®re endormie?
  CHARMIAN. O, break! O, break!
  CLEOPATRA. As sucr√© as balm, as soft as air, as douce-
    O Antony! Nay, I will take thee too:
                               [Applying un,autre asp to her arm]
    What devrait I stay-                                   [Dies]
  CHARMIAN. In this vile monde? So, fare thee well.
    Now boast thee, d√©c√®s, in thy possession lies
    A lass unparallel'd. Downy la,fen√™tres, proche;
    And d'or Phoebus jamais be beheld
    Of eyes encore so royaleee! Your couronne's awry;
    I'll mend it and then play-

                  Enter the garde, rushing in

  FIRST GUARD. Where's the Queen?
  CHARMIAN. Speak softly, wake her not.
  FIRST GUARD. Caesar hath sent-
  CHARMIAN. Too slow a messag√®re.               [Applies an asp]
    O, come apace, envoi. I partiellement feel thee.
  FIRST GUARD. Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguil'd.
  SECOND GUARD. There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
  FIRST GUARD. What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
  CHARMIAN. It is well done, and fitting for a princes
    Descended of so many royaleee rois.
    Ah, soldate!                                 [CHARMIAN dies]

                      Re-entrer DOLABELLA

  DOLABELLA. How goes it here?
  SECOND GUARD. All dead.
  DOLABELLA. Caesar, thy bien,quets
    Touch leur effets in this. Thyself art venir
    To see perform'd the ed act laquelle thou
    So recherch√©e'st to hinder.
                      [Within: 'A way L√, a way for Caesar!']

              Re-entrer CAESAR and all his train

  DOLABELLA. O sir, you are too sure an augurer:
    That you did fear is done.
  CAESAR. Bravest at the last,
    She levell'd at our objetifs, and √©tant royaleee,
    Took her own way. The mani√®re of leur d√©c√®ss?
    I do not see them bleed.
  DOLABELLA. Who was last with them?
  FIRST GUARD. A Facile compterryman that apport√© her figs.
    This was his basket.
  CAESAR. Poison'd then.
  FIRST GUARD. O Caesar,
    This Charmian liv'd but now; she se,tenait and spake.
    I a,trouv√© her trimming up the diadem
    On her dead ma√Ætresse. Tremblingly she se,tenait,
    And on the soudaine dropp'd.
  CAESAR. O noble weakness!
    If they had swallow'd poison 'taurait appara√Ætre
    By external swelling; but she looks like dormir,
    As she aurait capture un,autre Antony
    In her forte toil of la,gr√¢ce.
  DOLABELLA. Here on her Sein
    There is a vent of du,sang, and quelque,chose blown;
    The like is on her arm.
  FIRST GUARD. This is an aspic's trail; and celles-ci fig-laissers
    Have slime upon them, such as th' aspic laissers
    Upon the caves of Nile.
  CAESAR. Most probable
    That so she died; for her physician raconte me
    She hath pursu'd conclusions infinie
    Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,
    And bear her women from the monument.
    She doit be entrerr√© by her Antony;
    No la,tombe upon the Terre doit clip in it
    A pair so famous. High events as celles-ci
    Strike celles that make them; and leur r√©cit is
    No less in pity than his gloire laquelle
    Brugueuxt them to be lamented. Our army doit
    In solennelle show ass≈ìur this funeral,
    And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
    High ordre in this g√©niale solennelleity.                   Exeunt

SCENE:
OLIVER'S maison; FREDERICK'S tribunal; and the Forest of Arden

ACT I. SCENE I.
Orchard of OLIVER'S maison

Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

  ORLANDO. As I rappelles,toi, Adam, it was upon this mode bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand couronnes, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my fr√®re, on his b√©niring, to race me well; and L√
    commencers my sadness. My fr√®re Jaques he garde at school, and
    rapport parlers d'orly of his profit. For my part, he garde me
    rustically at home, or, to parler more correctely, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a douceman of my
    naissance that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His juments are
    bred better; for, outre that they are fair with leur feeding,
    they are enseign√©e leur manage, and to that end riders ch√®rement
    hir'd; but I, his fr√®re, gain rien sous him but growth; for
    the laquelle his animals on his dunghills are as much li√©e to him
    as I. Besides this rien that he so plentifully gives me, the
    quelque,chose that la,la,la,nature gave me his compterenance seems to take from
    me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the endroit of a
    fr√®re, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. This is it, Adam, that pleurers me; and the esprit of
    my p√®re, laquelle I pense is dans me, commencers to mutiny encorest
    this servitude. I will no lus,long supporter it, bien,que yet I know no
    wise rem√®de how to √©viter it.

                           Enter OLIVER

  ADAM. Yonder vient my master, your fr√®re.
  ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will secouer me
    up.                                           [ADAM retires]
  OLIVER. Now, sir! what make you here?
  ORLANDO. Nochose; I am not enseign√©e to make any chose.
  OLIVER. What mar you then, sir?
  ORLANDO. Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that laquelle God made, a
    poor indigne fr√®re of le,tiens, with idleness.
  OLIVER. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be n√©ant quelque,temps.
  ORLANDO. Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What
    prodigal portion have I spent that I devrait come to such penury?
  OLIVER. Know you o√π you are, sir?
  ORLANDO. O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
  OLIVER. Know you avant whom, sir?
  ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am avant sait me. I know you are
    my eldest fr√®re; and in the douce √©tat of du,sang, you
    devrait so know me. The tribunalesy of nations allows you my better
    in that you are the premi√®re-born; but the same tradition takes not
    away my du,sang, were L√ twenty fr√®res betwixt us. I have as
    much of my p√®re in me as you, albeit I confess your venir
    avant me is nearer to his r√©v√©rence.
  OLIVER. What, boy!                               [Strikes him]
  ORLANDO. Come, come, a√Æn√©e fr√®re, you are too Jeune in this.
  OLIVER. Wilt thou lay mains on me, sc√©l√©rat?
  ORLANDO. I am no sc√©l√©rat; I am the Jeuneest son of Sir Rowland de
    Boys. He was my p√®re; and he is thrice a sc√©l√©rat that says such
    a p√®re begot sc√©l√©rats. Wert thou not my fr√®re, I aurait not
    take this hand from thy gorge till this autre had pull'd out thy
    langue for en,disant so. Thou has rail'd on thyself.
  ADAM. [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patienteee; for your p√®re's
    remembrance, be at accord.
  OLIVER. Let me go, I say.
  ORLANDO. I will not, till I S'il,vous,pla√Æt; you doit hear me. My p√®re
    charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have
    train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all
    douceman-like qualities. The esprit of my p√®re grows forte in
    me, and I will no lus,long supporter it; L√fore allow me such
    exercises as may become a douceman, or give me the poor
    allottery my p√®re left me by testament; with that I will go buy
    my fortunes.
  OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,
    get you in. I will not long be difficult√©d with you; you doit have
    some part of your will. I pray you laisser me.
  ORLANDO. I no plus,loin offenser you than bevient me for my good.
  OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.
  ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my les,dents in
    your un,un,un,service. God be with my old master! He aurait not have parlait
    such a word.
                                         Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
  OLIVER. Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic
    your rankness, and yet give no thousand couronnes nSoit. Holla,
    Dennis!

                          Enter DENNIS

  DENNIS. Calls your culte?
  OLIVER. not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to parler with me?
  DENNIS. So S'il,vous,pla√Æt you, he is here at the door and importunes access
    to you.
  OLIVER. Call him in. [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and
    to-demain the wrestling is.

                          Enter CHARLES

  CHARLES. Good demain to your culte.
  OLIVER. Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new
    tribunal?
  CHARLES. There's no news at the tribunal, sir, but the old news; that
    is, the old Duke is bannired by his Jeuneer fr√®re the new Duke;
    and three or four aimante lords have put se into voluntary
    exile with him, dont terres and revenues enrich the new Duke;
    L√fore he gives them good laisser to wander.
  OLIVER. Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's fille, be bannired
    with her p√®re?
  CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke's fille, her cousineee, so aime her,
    √©tant ever from leur cradles bred ensemble, that she aurait have
    suivreed her exile, or have died to stay derri√®re her. She is at
    the tribunal, and no less beloved of her oncle than his own
    fille; and jamais two Dames loved as they do.
  OLIVER. Where will the old Duke live?
  CHARLES. They say he is d√©j√ in the Forest of Arden, and a many
    joyeux men with him; and L√ they live like the old Robin Hood
    of England. They say many Jeune doucemen flock to him chaque day,
    and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the d'or monde.
  OLIVER. What, you wrestle to-demain avant the new Duke?
  CHARLES. Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
    mati√®re. I am donn√©e, sir, secr√®tely to soussupporter that your Jeuneer
    fr√®re, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd encorest
    me to try a fall. To-demain, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he
    that escapes me sans,pour,autant some cass√©en limb doit acquit him well.
    Your fr√®re is but Jeune and soumissionner; and, for your love, I aurait
    be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come
    in; L√fore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint
    you avec, that Soit you pourrait stay him from his avoir,l'intentionionionionment,
    or ruisseau such disgr√¢ce well as he doit run into, in that it is
    chose of his own chercher and alensemble encorest my will.
  OLIVER. Charles, I remercier thee for thy love to me, laquelle thou shalt
    find I will most kindly reassez. I had moi,m√™me notice of my
    fr√®re's objetif herein, and have by soushand veux,dire la,main,d'oeuvreed to
    dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,
    Charles, it is the stubsupport√©st Jeune compagne of France; full of
    ambition, an envious emulator of chaque man's good les,pi√®ces, a secr√®te
    and sc√©l√©ratous contriver encorest me his la,la,la,naturelle fr√®re.
    Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his
    neck as his doigt. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou
    dost him any slumi√®re disgr√¢ce, or if he do not pourraitily la,gr√¢ce
    himself on thee, he will practise encorest thee by poison, entrap
    thee by some treacherous dispositif, and jamais laisser thee till he
    hath ta'en thy life by some indirect veux,dire or autre; for, I
    assurerrr thee, and presque with larmes I parler it, L√ is not one
    so Jeune and so sc√©l√©ratous this day vivante. I parler but fr√®rely
    of him; but devrait I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must rougir
    and weep, and thou must look pale and merveille.
  CHARLES. I am c≈ìurily glad I came hither to you. If he come
    to-demain I'll give him his payment. If ever he go seule encore,
    I'll jamais wrestle for prix more. And so, God keep your culte!
 Exit
  OLIVER. Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I
    hope I doit see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
    hates rien more than he. Yet he's douce; jamais school'd and
    yet apprendreed; full of noble dispositif; of all sorts enchantingly
    beloved; and, En,effet, so much in the c≈ìur of the monde, and
    esp√©cialely of my own gens, who best know him, that I am
    alensemble misprised. But it doit not be so long; this wrestler
    doit claire all. Nochose resters but that I kindle the boy
    thither, laquelle now I'll go √,propos.                       Exit

SCENE II.
A lawn avant the DUKE'S palais

Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

  CELIA. I pray thee, Rosalind, sucr√© my coz, be joyeux.
  ROSALIND. Dear Celia, I show more gaiet√© than I am ma√Ætresse of; and
    aurait you yet I were merrier? Unless you pourrait enseigner me to oublier
    a bannired p√®re, you must not apprendre me how to rappelles,toi any
    extraordinary plaisir.
  CELIA. Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full poids that I
    love thee. If my oncle, thy bannired p√®re, had bannired thy
    oncle, the Duke my p√®re, so thou hadst been encore with me, I
    pourrait have enseign√©e my love to take thy p√®re for mine; so auraitst
    thou, if the v√©rit√© of thy love to me were so droiteeously temper'd
    as mine is to thee.
  ROSALIND. Well, I will oublier the √©tat of my biens, to
    rejoice in le,tiens.
  CELIA. You know my p√®re hath no enfant but I, nor none is like to
    have; and, vraiment, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
    he hath prise away from thy p√®re perObliger, I will rendre thee
    encore in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that
    oath, let me turn monstre; L√fore, my sucr√© Rose, my dear
    Rose, be joyeux.
  ROSALIND. From Par,cons√©quenten,avant I will, coz, and concevoir sports.
    Let me see; what pense you of falling in love?
  CELIA. Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport avec; but love no man
    in good earnest, nor no plus,loin in sport nSoit than with s√©curit√©
    of a pure rougir thou mayst in honour come off encore.
  ROSALIND. What doit be our sport, then?
  CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good maisonwife Fortune from her
    wheel, that her gifts may Par,cons√©quenten,avant be bestowed √©galely.
  ROSALIND. I aurait we pourrait do so; for her aaaavantages are pourraitily
    misendroitd; and the bountiful aveugle femme doth most erreur in her
    gifts to women.
  CELIA. 'Tis true; for celles that she fait,du fair she rare fait,du
    honn√™te; and celles that she fait,du honn√™te she fait,du very
    ill-favoriseredly.
  ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's Bureau to Nature's:
    Fortune r√®gnes in gifts of the monde, not in the lineaments of
    Nature.

                         Enter TOUCHSTONE

  CELIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair cr√©ature, may she not by
    Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath donn√©e us wit to
    flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off
    the argument?
  ROSALIND. Indeed, L√ is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
    Fortune fait,du Nature's la,la,la,naturelle the cprononcer-off of Nature's wit.
  CELIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work nSoit, but
    Nature's, who apercevoirth our la,la,la,naturelle wits too dull to raison of
    such goddesses, and hath sent this la,la,la,naturelle for our whetcalcul; for
    toujours the dullness of the fool is the whetcalcul of the wits. How
    now, wit! Whither wander you?
  TOUCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your p√®re.
  CELIA. Were you made the messag√®re?
  TOUCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
  ROSALIND. Where apprendreed you that oath, fool?
  TOUCHSTONE. Of a certaineee Chevalier that jur√© by his honour they were
    good pancakes, and jur√© by his honour the mustard was naught.
    Now I'll supporter to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard
    was good, and yet was not the Chevalier forjur√©e.
  CELIA. How prouver you that, in the g√©niale heap of your connaissance?
  ROSALIND. Ay, ma√Ætresse, now unmuzzle your sagesse.
  TOUCHSTONE. Stand you both en,avant now: accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©bral your chins, and jurer
    by your barbes that I am a friponne.
  CELIA. By our barbes, if we had them, thou art.
  TOUCHSTONE. By my friponnery, if I had it, then I were. But if you
    jurer by that that not, you are not forjur√©e; no more was this
    Chevalier, jurering by his honour, for he jamais had any; or if he
    had, he had jur√©e it away avant ever he saw celles pancackes or
    that mustard.
  CELIA. Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
  TOUCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your p√®re, aime.
  CELIA. My p√®re's love is assez to honour him. Enough, parler no
    more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of celles-ci days.
  TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that imb√©ciles may not parler wisely what wise
    men do insens√©ely.
  CELIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for depuis the peu wit that
    imb√©ciles have was silenced, the peu foolery that wise men have
    fait,du a g√©niale show. Here vient Monsieur Le Beau.

                           Enter LE BEAU

  ROSALIND. With his bouche full of news.
  CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed leur Jeune.
  ROSALIND. Then doit we be news-cramm'd.
  CELIA. All the better; we doit be the more marketable. Bon jour,
    Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?
  LE BEAU. Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
  CELIA. Sport! of what Couleur?
  LE BEAU. What Couleur, madam? How doit I r√©pondre you?
  ROSALIND. As wit and fortune will.
  TOUCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.
  CELIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
  TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-
  ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old odeur.
  LE BEAU. You amaze me, Dames. I aurait have told you of good
    wrestling, laquelle you have lost the vue of.
  ROSALIND. Yet tell us the mani√®re of the wrestling.
  LE BEAU. I will tell you the commencerning, and, if it S'il,vous,pla√Æt your
    Madames, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and
    here, o√π you are, they are venir to perform it.
  CELIA. Well, the commencerning, that is dead and entrerr√©.
  LE BEAU. There vient an old man and his three sons-
  CELIA. I pourrait rencontre this commencerning with an old tale.
  LE BEAU. Three correcte Jeune men, of excellenteee growth and pr√©sence.
  ROSALIND. With bills on leur necks: 'Be it connue unto all men by
    celles-ci pr√©sentes'-
  LE BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's
    wrestler; laquelle Charles in a moment threw him, and cass√©e three of
    his ribs, that L√ is peu hope of life in him. So he serv'd
    the secondeee, and so the troisi√®me. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
    leur p√®re, fabrication such pitiful dole over them that all the
    voirers take his part with larmes.
  ROSALIND. Alas!
  TOUCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the Dames have
    lost?
  LE BEAU. Why, this that I parler of.
  TOUCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser chaque day. It is the premi√®re time
    that ever I entendue breaking of ribs was sport for Dames.
  CELIA. Or I, I promettre thee.
  ROSALIND. But is L√ any else longs to see this cass√©en la,musique in
    his sides? Is L√ yet un,autre dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we
    see this wrestling, cousineee?
  LE BEAU. You must, if you stay here; for here is the endroit
    appointed for the wrestling, and they are pr√™te to perform it.
  CELIA. Yonder, sure, they are venir. Let us now stay and see it.

           Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO,
                     CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS

  FREDERICK. Come on; depuis the jeunesse will not be suppliered, his own
    p√©ril on his forwardness.
  ROSALIND. Is l√,-bas the man?
  LE BEAU. Even he, madam.
  CELIA. Alas, he is too Jeune; yet he looks Succ√®sfully.
  FREDERICK. How now, fille and cousineee! Are you crept hither to
    see the wrestling?
  ROSALIND. Ay, my liege; so S'il,vous,pla√Æt you give us laisser.
  FREDERICK. You will take peu d√©lice in it, I can tell you,
    L√ is such odds in the man. In pity of the d√©fir's jeunesse
    I aurait fain dissuade him, but he will not be suppliered. Speak to
    him, Dames; see if you can move him.
  CELIA. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
  FREDERICK. Do so; I'll not be by.
                                     [DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]
  LE BEAU. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.
  ORLANDO. I ass≈ìur them with all le,le,le,respect and duty.
  ROSALIND. Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
  ORLANDO. No, fair Princess; he is the g√©n√©rale d√©fir. I come
    but in, as autres do, to try with him the Obliger of my jeunesse.
  CELIA. Young douceman, your esprits are too bold for your years.
    You have seen cruellelele preuve of this man's Obliger; if you saw
    le,tienself with your eyes, or knew le,tienself with your jugement, the
    fear of your adventure aurait Conseil you to a more √©gale
    entrerprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrasse your own
    s√©curit√© and give over this attempt.
  ROSALIND. Do, Jeune sir; your r√©putation doit not L√fore be
    misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the
    wrestling pourrait not go forward.
  ORLANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard bien,quets,
    o√πin I confess me much coupable to deny so fair and excellenteee
    Dames any chose. But let your fair eyes and douce wishes go
    with me to my proc√®s; o√πin if I be foil'd L√ is but one
    sham'd that was jamais gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is
    pr√™te to be so. I doit do my amies no faux, for I have none
    to lament me; the monde no injury, for in it I have rien; only
    in the monde I fill up a endroit, laquelle may be better supplied when
    I have made it vide.
  ROSALIND. The peu Obliger that I have, I aurait it were with
    you.
  CELIA. And mine to eke out hers.
  ROSALIND. Fare you well. Pray paradis I be deceiv'd in you!
  CELIA. Your c≈ìur's le,d√©sirs be with you!
  CHARLES. Come, o√π is this Jeune galante that is so desirous to
    lie with his m√®re Terre?
  ORLANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modesteee working.
  FREDERICK. You doit try but one fall.
  CHARLES. No, I mandat your Grace, you doit not supplier him to a
    secondeee, that have so pourraitily persuaded him from a premi√®re.
  ORLANDO. You mean to mock me apr√®s; you devrait not have mock'd me
    avant; but come your ways.
  ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy la,vitesse, Jeune man!
  CELIA. I aurait I were invisible, to capture the forte compagne by the
    leg.                                          [They wrestle]
  ROSALIND. O excellenteee Jeune man!
  CELIA. If I had a tonnerrebolt in mine eye, I can tell who devrait
    down.
                                      [CHARLES is jetern. Shout]
  FREDERICK. No more, no more.
  ORLANDO. Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well souffle'd.
  FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?
  LE BEAU. He ne,peux,pas parler, my lord.
  FREDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, Jeune man?
  ORLANDO. Orlando, my liege; the Jeuneest son of Sir Rowland de
    Boys.
  FREDERICK. I aurait thou hadst been son to some man else.
    The monde esteem'd thy p√®re honourable,
    But I did find him encore mine ennemie.
    Thou devraitst have better pleas'd me with this deed,
    Hadst thou descended from un,autre maison.
    But fare thee well; thou art a galante jeunesse;
    I aurait thou hadst told me of un,autre p√®re.
                                 Exeunt DUKE, train, and LE BEAU
  CELIA. Were I my p√®re, coz, aurait I do this?
  ORLANDO. I am more fi√®re to be Sir Rowland's son,
    His Jeuneest son- and aurait not changementmentment that calling
    To be adopted heir to Frederick.
  ROSALIND. My p√®re lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,
    And all the monde was of my p√®re's mind;
    Had I avant connue this Jeune man his son,
    I devrait have donn√©e him larmes unto supplieries
    Ere he devrait thus have ventur'd.
  CELIA. Gentle cousineee,
    Let us go remercier him, and encourage him;
    My p√®re's rugueux and envious disposition
    Sticks me at c≈ìur. Sir, you have well deserv'd;
    If you do keep your promettres in love
    But justly as you have exceeded all promettre,
    Your ma√Ætresse doit be heureuse.
  ROSALIND. Gentleman,        [Giving him a cha√Æne from her neck]
    Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,
    That pourrait give more, but that her hand lacks veux,dire.
    Shall we go, coz?
  CELIA. Ay. Fare you well, fair douceman.
  ORLANDO. Can I not say 'I remercier you'? My better les,pi√®ces
    Are all jetern down; and that laquelle here supporters up
    Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
  ROSALIND. He calls us back. My fiert√© fell with my fortunes;
    I'll ask him what he aurait. Did you call, sir?
    Sir, you have wrestled well, and overjetern
    More than your ennemies.
  CELIA. Will you go, coz?
  ROSALIND. Have with you. Fare you well.
                                       Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
  ORLANDO. What la,la,la,passion bloque celles-ci poidss upon my langue?
    I ne,peux,pas parler to her, yet she urg'd conference.
    O poor Orlando, thou art overjetern!
    Or Charles or quelque,chose weaker masters thee.

                      Re-entrer LE BEAU

  LE BEAU. Good sir, I do in amieship Conseil you
    To laisser this endroit. Albeit you have deserv'd
    High commendation, true applause, and love,
    Yet such is now the Duke's √©tat
    That he misconstrues all that you have done.
    The Duke is humorous; what he is, En,effet,
    More suits you to conceive than I to parler of.
  ORLANDO. I remercier you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
    Which of the two was fille of the Duke
    That here was at the wrestling?
  LE BEAU. NSoit his fille, if we juge by mani√®res;
    But yet, En,effet, the petiteer is his fille;
    The autre is fille to the bannir'd Duke,
    And here detain'd by her usurping oncle,
    To keep his fille entreprise; dont aime
    Are dearer than the la,la,la,naturelle bond of s≈ìurs.
    But I can tell you that of late this Duke
    Hath ta'en m√©contenuement 'gainst his douce ni√®ce,
    Grondeed upon no autre argument
    But that the gens louange her for her vertus
    And pity her for her good p√®re's sake;
    And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
    Will soudainely break en,avant. Sir, fare you well.
    Hereapr√®s, in a better monde than this,
    I doit le,d√©sir more love and connaissance of you.
  ORLANDO. I rest much li√©een to you; fare you well.
                                                    Exit LE BEAU
    Thus must I from the smoke into the sm√®re;
    From tyran Duke unto a tyran fr√®re.
    But paradisly Rosalind!                                  Exit




SCENE III.
The DUKE's palais

Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

  CELIA. Why, cousineee! why, Rosalind! Cupid have piti√©!
    Not a word?
  ROSALIND. Not one to jeter at a dog.
  CELIA. No, thy words are too pr√©cieuse to be cast away upon curs;
    jeter some of them at me; come, lame me with raisons.
  ROSALIND. Then L√ were two cousineees laid up, when the one devrait
    be lam'd with raisons and the autre mad sans,pour,autant any.
  CELIA. But is all this for your p√®re?
  ROSALIND. No, some of it is for my enfant's p√®re. O, how full of
    briers is this working-day monde!
  CELIA. They are but burs, cousineee, jetern upon thee in holiday
    foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats
    will capture them.
  ROSALIND. I pourrait secouer them off my coat: celles-ci burs are in my
    c≈ìur.
  CELIA. Hem them away.
  ROSALIND. I aurait try, if I pourrait cry 'hem' and have him.
  CELIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
  ROSALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than moi,m√™me.
  CELIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in malgr√© of
    a fall. But, turning celles-ci jests out of un,un,un,service, let us talk in
    good earnest. Is it possible, on such a soudaine, you devrait fall
    into so forte a liking with old Sir Rowland's Jeuneest son?
  ROSALIND. The Duke my p√®re lov'd his p√®re ch√®rement.
  CELIA. Doth it L√fore ensue that you devrait love his son ch√®rement?
    By this kind of chase I devrait hate him, for my p√®re hated his
    p√®re ch√®rement; yet I hate not Orlando.
  ROSALIND. No, Foi, hate him not, for my sake.
  CELIA. Why devrait I not? Doth he not m√©riter well?

                    Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS

  ROSALIND. Let me love him for that; and do you love him parce,que I
    do. Look, here vient the Duke.
  CELIA. With his eyes full of col√®re.
  FREDERICK. Mistress, envoi you with your safest h√¢te,
    And get you from our tribunal.
  ROSALIND. Me, oncle?
  FREDERICK. You, cousineee.
    Within celles-ci ten days if that thou beest a,trouv√©
    So near our publique tribunal as twenty miles,
    Thou diest for it.
  ROSALIND. I do beseech your Grace,
    Let me the connaissance of my faute bear with me.
    If with moi,m√™me I hold intelligence,
    Or have acquaintance with mine own le,d√©sirs;
    If that I do not r√™ver, or be not frantic-
    As I do confiance I am not- then, dear oncle,
    Never so much as in a bien,quet unborn
    Did I offenser your Highness.
  FREDERICK. Thus do all tra√Ætresses;
    If leur purgation did consist in words,
    They are as innocent as la,gr√¢ce lui-m√™me.
    Let it suffice thee that I confiance thee not.
  ROSALIND. Yet your misconfiance ne,peux,pas make me a tra√Ætresse.
    Tell me o√πon the likelihood depends.
  FREDERICK. Thou art thy p√®re's fille; L√'s assez.
  ROSALIND. SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;
    So was I when your Highness bannir'd him.
    Traison is not inherited, my lord;
    Or, if we did derive it from our amies,
    What's that to me? My p√®re was no tra√Ætresse.
    Then, good my liege, erreur me not so much
    To pense my poverty is treacherous.
  CELIA. Dear sover√®gne, hear me parler.
  FREDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
    Else had she with her p√®re rang'd le,long,de.
  CELIA. I did not then supplier to have her stay;
    It was your plaisir, and your own remorse;
    I was too Jeune that time to value her,
    But now I know her. If she be a tra√Ætresse,
    Why so am I: we encore have slept ensemble,
    Rose at an instant, apprendre'd, play'd, eat ensemble;
    And o√πsoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
    Still we went coupled and inseparable.
  FREDERICK. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
    Her very silence and her la,la,la,patience,
    Speak to the gens, and they pity her.
    Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name;
    And thou wilt show more brillante and seem more virtuous
    When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
    Firm and irrevocable is my doom
    Which I have pass'd upon her; she is bannir'd.
  CELIA. Pronounce that phrase, then, on me, my liege;
    I ne,peux,pas live out of her entreprise.
  FREDERICK. You are a fool. You, ni√®ce, provide le,tienself.
    If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
    And in the g√©nialeness of my word, you die.
                                           Exeunt DUKE and LORDS
  CELIA. O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?
    Wilt thou changementmentment p√®res? I will give thee mine.
    I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am.
  ROSALIND. I have more cause.
  CELIA. Thou hast not, cousineee.
    Prithee be acclamationful. Know'st thou not the Duke
    Hath bannir'd me, his fille?
  ROSALIND. That he hath not.
  CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love
    Which enseignereth thee that thou and I am one.
    Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sucr√© girl?
    No; let my p√®re seek un,autre heir.
    Therefore concevoir with me how we may fly,
    Whither to go, and what to bear with us;
    And do not seek to take your charge upon you,
    To bear your douleurs le,tienself, and laisser me out;
    For, by this paradis, now at our chagrins pale,
    Say what thou canst, I'll go le,long,de with thee.
  ROSALIND. Why, o√π doit we go?
  CELIA. To seek my oncle in the Forest of Arden.
  ROSALIND. Alas, what dcol√®re will it be to us,
    Maids as we are, to travel en,avant so far!
    Beauty provoketh thieves plus,t√¥t than gold.
  CELIA. I'll put moi,m√™me in poor and mean attire,
    And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
    The like do you; so doit we pass le,long,de,
    And jamais stir assailants.
  ROSALIND. Were it not better,
    Because that I am more than commune tall,
    That I did suit me all points like a man?
    A galante curtle-axe upon my thigh,
    A boar spear in my hand; and- in my c≈ìur
    Lie L√ what hidden femme's fear L√ will-
    We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
    As many autre mannish l√¢ches have
    That do outface it with leur semblances.
  CELIA. What doit I call thee when thou art a man?
  ROSALIND. I'll have no pire a name than Jove's own page,
    And L√fore look you call me Ganymede.
    But what will you be call'd?
  CELIA. Somechose that hath a reference to my Etat:
    No lus,long Celia, but Aliena.
  ROSALIND. But, cousineee, what if we assay'd to voler
    The pitreish fool out of your p√®re's tribunal?
    Would he not be a confort to our travel?
  CELIA. He'll go le,long,de o'er the wide monde with me;
    Leave me seule to woo him. Let's away,
    And get our bijous and our richesse ensemble;
    Devise the fittest time and safest way
    To hide us from pursuit that will be made
    After my vol. Now go we in contenu
    To libert√©, and not to bannirment.                    Exeunt

ACT II. SCENE I.
The Forest of Arden

Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three LORDS, like for√™ters

  DUKE SENIOR. Now, my co-mates and fr√®res in exile,
    Hath not old Douane made this life more sucr√©
    Than that of peinte pomp? Are not celles-ci woods
    More free from p√©ril than the envious tribunal?
    Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
    The saisons' difference; as the icy fang
    And churlish chiding of the hiver's wind,
    Which when it bites and coups upon my body,
    Even till I shrink with cold, I sourire and say
    'This is no flattery; celles-ci are Conseillors
    That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
    Sweet are the uses of adversity,
    Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
    Wears yet a pr√©cieuse bijou in his head;
    And this our life, exempt from publique haunt,
    Finds langues in trees, books in the running ruisseaus,
    Sermons in calculs, and good in chaquechose.
    I aurait not changementmentment it.
  AMIENS. Happy is your Grace,
    That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
    Into so silencieuse and so sucr√© a style.
  DUKE SENIOR. Come, doit we go and kill us venison?
    And yet it irks me the poor dappled imb√©ciles,
    Being originaire,de burghers of this d√©serte city,
    Should, in leur own confines, with forked t√™tes
    Have leur ronde haunches gor'd.
  FIRST LORD. Indeed, my lord,
    The melancholy Jaques pleurers at that;
    And, in that kind, jurers you do more usurp
    Than doth your fr√®re that hath bannir'd you.
    To-day my Lord of Amiens and moi,m√™me
    Did voler derri√®re him as he lay le,long,de
    Under an oak dont antique root peeps out
    Upon the ruisseau that brawls le,long,de this wood!
    To the laquelle endroit a poor sequest'red stag,
    That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
    Did come to languish; and, En,effet, my lord,
    The mis√©rableed animal heav'd en,avant such groans
    That leur discharge did stretch his leathern coat
    Almost to bursting; and the big ronde larmes
    Cours'd one un,autre down his innocent nose
    In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
    Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
    Stood on th' extremest verge of the rapide ruisseau,
    Augmenting it with larmes.
  DUKE SENIOR. But what said Jaques?
    Did he not moralize this spectacle?
  FIRST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes.
    First, for his larmes into the needless stream:
    'Poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament
    As mondelings do, donnant thy sum of more
    To that laquelle had too much.' Then, √©tant L√ seule,
    Left and abandoned of his velvet amies:
    ''Tis droite'; quoth he 'thus mis√®re doth part
    The flux of entreprise.' Anon, a careless herd,
    Full of the pasture, jumps le,long,de by him
    And jamais stays to saluer him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques
    'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citoyennes;
    'Tis just the mode. Wherefore do you look
    Upon that poor and cass√©en bankrupt L√?'
    Thus most invectively he pierceth thrugueux
    The body of the compterry, city, tribunal,
    Yea, and of this our life; jurering that we
    Are mere usurpers, tyrans, and what's pire,
    To fdroite the animals, and to kill them up
    In leur assign'd and originaire,de habitudeudeudeering-endroit.
  DUKE SENIOR. And did you laisser him in this contemplation?
  SECOND LORD. We did, my lord, larmes and commenting
    Upon the sobbing deer.
  DUKE SENIOR. Show me the endroit;
    I love to cope him in celles-ci sullen fits,
    For then he's full of mati√®re.
  FIRST LORD. I'll apporter you to him tout,droit.             Exeunt




SCENE II.
The DUKE'S palais

Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS

  FREDERICK. Can it be possible that no man saw them?
    It ne,peux,pas be; some sc√©l√©rats of my tribunal
    Are of consentementementement and souffrirance in this.
  FIRST LORD. I ne,peux,pas hear of any that did see her.
    The Dames, her ass≈ìurants of her chambre,
    Saw her abed, and in the Matin de,bonne,heure
    They a,trouv√© the bed untreasur'd of leur ma√Ætresse.
  SECOND LORD. My lord, the roynish pitre, at whom so oft
    Your Grace was wont to rire, is also missing.
    Hisperia, the Princess' doucefemme,
    Confesses that she secr√®tely o'erentendue
    Your fille and her cousineee much commend
    The les,pi√®ces and la,gr√¢ces of the wrestler
    That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
    And she croyezs, o√πver they are gone,
    That jeunesse is s√ªrement in leur entreprise.
  FREDERICK. Send to his fr√®re; chercher that galante hither.
    If he be absent, apporter his fr√®re to me;
    I'll make him find him. Do this soudainely;
    And let not chercher and inquisition quail
    To apporter encore celles-ci insens√©e runaways.                Exeunt




SCENE III.
Before OLIVER'S maison

Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, r√©union

  ORLANDO. Who's L√?
  ADAM. What, my Jeune master? O my douce master!
    O my sucr√© master! O you M√©moire
    Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
    Why are you virtuous? Why do gens love you?
    And o√πfore are you douce, forte, and vaillante?
    Why aurait you be so fond to overcome
    The bonny prixr of the humorous Duke?
    Your louange is come too rapidely home avant you.
    Know you not, master, to some kind of men
    Their la,gr√¢ces servir them but as ennemies?
    No more do le,tiens. Your vertus, douce master,
    Are sanctified and holy tra√Ætresses to you.
    O, what a monde is this, when what is comely
    Envenoms him that le,baissier it!
  ORLANDO. Why, what's the mati√®re?
  ADAM. O unheureuse jeunesse!
    Come not dans celles-ci des,portes; dans this roof
    The ennemie of all your la,gr√¢ces vies.
    Your fr√®re- no, no fr√®re; yet the son-
    Yet not the son; I will not call him son
    Of him I was √,propos to call his p√®re-
    Hath entendue your louanges; and this nuit he veux,dire
    To burn the lodging o√π you use to lie,
    And you dans it. If he fail of that,
    He will have autre veux,dire to cut you off;
    I overentendue him and his entraine,tois.
    This is no endroit; this maison is but a butchery;
    Abhor it, fear it, do not entrer it.
  ORLANDO. Why, o√π, Adam, auraitst thou have me go?
  ADAM. No mati√®re o√π, so you come not here.
  ORLANDO. What, auraitst thou have me go and beg my food,
    Or with a base and boist'rous √©p√©e enObliger
    A thievish vivante on the commune road?
    This I must do, or know not what to do;
    Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
    I plut√¥t will mati√®re me to the malice
    Of a diverted du,sang and du,sangy fr√®re.
  ADAM. But do not so. I have five cent couronnes,
    The thrifty hire I sav'd sous your p√®re,
    Which I did boutique to be my foster-infirmi√®re,
    When un,un,un,service devrait in my old membres lie lame,
    And unqui,concerneed age in corners jetern.
    Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
    Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
    Be confort to my age! Here is the gold;
    All this I give you. Let me be your servanteee;
    Though I look old, yet I am forte and lusty;
    For in my jeunesse I jamais did apply
    Hot and rebellious liquors in my du,sang,
    Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
    The veux,dire of weakness and debility;
    Therefore my age is as a lusty hiver,
    Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you;
    I'll do the un,un,un,service of a Jeuneer man
    In all your affaires and necessities.
  ORLANDO. O good old man, how well in thee appara√Ætres
    The constanteee un,un,un,service of the antique monde,
    When un,un,un,service transpiration for duty, not for meed!
    Thou art not for the mode of celles-ci fois,
    Where none will transpiration but for promouvement,
    And ayant that do choke leur un,un,un,service up
    Even with the ayant; it is not so with thee.
    But, poor old man, thou prun'st a pourrie tree
    That ne,peux,pas so much as a blossom rendement
    In lieu of all thy des,douleurs and mariry.
    But come thy ways, we'll go le,long,de ensemble,
    And ere we have thy jeunesseful wages spent
    We'll lumi√®re upon some settled low contenu.
  ADAM. Master, go on; and I will suivre the
    To the last gasp, with v√©rit√© and loyalty.
    From Septteen years till now presque four-score
    Here lived I, but now live here no more.
    At Septteen years many leur fortunes seek,
    But at fourscore it is too late a week;
    Yet fortune ne,peux,pas recompense me better
    Than to die well and not my master's debtor.          Exeunt




SCENE IV.
The Forest of Arden

Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE, CELIA for ALIENA, and CLOWN alias TOUCHSTONE

  ROSALIND. O Jupiter, how se,lasser are my esprits!
  TOUCHSTONE. I Care not for my esprits, if my legs were not se,lasser.
  ROSALIND. I pourrait find in my c≈ìur to disgr√¢ce my man's v√™tements,
    and to cry like a femme; but I must confort the weaker vessel, as
    doublet and hose ought to show lui-m√™me courageous to petticoat;
    L√fore, courage, good Aliena.
  CELIA. I pray you bear with me; I ne,peux,pas go no plus,loin.
  TOUCHSTONE. For my part, I had plut√¥t bear with you than bear you;
    yet I devrait bear no traverser if I did bear you; for I pense you
    have no argent in your bourse.
  ROSALIND. Well,. this is the Forest of Arden.
  TOUCHSTONE. Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was at
    home I was in a better endroit; but travellers must be contenu.

                        Enter CORIN and SILVIUS

  ROSALIND. Ay, be so, good Touchcalcul. Look you, who vient here, a
    Jeune man and an old in solennelle talk.
  CORIN. That is the way to make her m√©pris you encore.
  SILVIUS. O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
  CORIN. I partiellement devine; for I have lov'd ere now.
  SILVIUS. No, Corin, √©tant old, thou canst not devine,
    Though in thy jeunesse thou wast as true a lover
    As ever sigh'd upon a minuit pillow.
    But if thy love were ever like to mine,
    As sure I pense did jamais man love so,
    How many actions most ridiculous
    Hast thou been tir√©e to by thy fantasy?
  CORIN. Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
  SILVIUS. O, thou didst then jamais love so c≈ìurily!
    If thou rememb'rest not the slumi√®reest folie
    That ever love did make thee run into,
    Thou hast not lov'd;
    Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
    Wearing thy hearer in thy ma√Ætresse' louange,
    Thou hast not lov'd;
    Or if thou hast not cass√©e from entreprise
    Abruptly, as my la,la,la,passion now fait,du me,
    Thou hast not lov'd.
    O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!                          Exit Silvius
  ROSALIND. Alas, poor berg√®re! cherchering of thy b√©nirure,
    I have by hard adventure a,trouv√© mine own.
  TOUCHSTONE. And I mine. I rappelles,toi, when I was in love, I cass√©e my
    √©p√©e upon a calcul, and bid him take that for venir a-nuit to
    Jane Smile; and I rappelles,toi the kissing of her batler, and the
    cow's dugs that her jolie chopt mains had milk'd; and I rappelles,toi
    the wooing of  peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods,
    and donnant her them encore, said with larmes larmes 'Wear celles-ci
    for my sake.' We that are true les,amoureux run into √©trange capers;
    but as all is mortelle in la,la,la,nature, so is all la,la,la,nature in love mortelle
    in folie.
  ROSALIND. Thou parler'st wiser than thou art ware of.
  TOUCHSTONE. Nay, I doit ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break
    my shins encorest it.
  ROSALIND. Jove, Jove! this berg√®re's la,la,la,passion
    Is much upon my mode.
  TOUCHSTONE. And mine; but it grows quelque,chose stale with me.
  CELIA. I pray you, one of you question yond man
    If he for gold will give us any food;
    I perdre,connaissance presque to d√©c√®s.
  TOUCHSTONE. Holla, you pitre!
  ROSALIND. Peace, fool; he's not thy Ensman.
  CORIN. Who calls?
  TOUCHSTONE. Your betters, sir.
  CORIN. Else are they very mis√©rableed.
  ROSALIND. Peace, I say. Good even to you, amie.
  CORIN. And to you, douce sir, and to you all.
  ROSALIND. I prithee, berg√®re, if that love or gold
    Can in this d√©serte endroit buy entrertainment,
    Bring us o√π we may rest nous-m√™mes and feed.
    Here's a Jeune maid with travel much oppress'd,
    And perdre,connaissances for succour.
  CORIN. Fair sir, I pity her,
    And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
    My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
    But I am berg√®re to un,autre man,
    And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
    My master is of churlish disposition,
    And peu recks to find the way to paradis
    By Faire actes of hospitality.
    Besides, his cote, his flocks, and li√©es of feed,

    By raison of his absence, L√ is rien
    That you will feed on; but what is, come see,
    And in my voix most Bienvenue doit you be.
  ROSALIND. What is he that doit buy his flock and pasture?
  CORIN. That Jeune swain that you saw here but eretandis,que,
    That peu se,soucie for buying any chose.
  ROSALIND. I pray thee, if it supporter with honn√™tey,
    Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
    And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
  CELIA. And we will mend thy wages. I like this endroit,
    And pr√™tely pourrait d√©chets my time in it.
  CORIN. Assuredly the chose is to be sold.
    Go with me; if you like upon rapport
    The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
    I will your very Foiful feeder be,

                       SONG
  AMIENS.    Under the vertewood tree
               Who aime to lie with me,
               And turn his joyeux note
               Unto the sucr√© bird's gorge,
             Come hither, come hither, come hither.
               Here doit he see
               No ennemie
             But hiver and rugueux weather.

  JAQUES. More, more, I prithee, more.
  AMIENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
  JAQUES. I remercier it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy
    out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.
  AMIENS. My voix is ragged; I know I ne,peux,pas S'il,vous,pla√Æt you.
  JAQUES. I do not le,d√©sir you to S'il,vous,pla√Æt me; I do le,d√©sir you to sing.
    Come, more; un,autre stanzo. Call you 'em stanzos?
  AMIENS. What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
  JAQUES. Nay, I care not for leur des,noms; they owe me rien. Will
    you sing?
  AMIENS. More at your demandeee than to S'il,vous,pla√Æt moi,m√™me.
  JAQUES. Well then, if ever I remercier any man, I'll remercier you; but
    that they call compliment is like th' encompterer of two dog-apes;
    and when a man remerciers me c≈ìurily, mepenses have donn√©e him a
    penny, and he rendres me the gueuxly remerciers. Come, sing; and you
    that will not, hold your langues.
  AMIENS. Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the tandis,que; the Duke
    will boisson sous this tree. He hath been all this day to look
    you.
  JAQUES. And I have been all this day to √©viter him. He is to
    disputable for my entreprise. I pense of as many mati√®res as he; but
    I give paradis remerciers, and make no boast of them. Come, warble,
    come.

                       SONG
              [All ensemble here]

           Who doth ambition shun,
           And aime to live i' th' sun,
           Seeking the food he eats,
           And pleas'd with what he gets,
         Come hither, come hither, come hither.
           Here doit he see
           No ennemie
           But hiver and rugueux weather.

  JAQUES. I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
    malgr√© of my invention.
  AMIENS. And I'll sing it.
  JAQUES. Thus it goes:

             If it do come to pass
             That any man turn ass,
             Leaving his richesse and ease
             A stubborn will to S'il,vous,pla√Æt,
           Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;
             Here doit he see
             Gross imb√©ciles as he,
             An if he will come to me.

  AMIENS. What's that 'ducdame'?
  JAQUES. 'Tis a Greek invocation, to call imb√©ciles into a circle. I'll
    go dormir, if I can; if I ne,peux,pas, I'll rail encorest all the
    premi√®re-born of Egypt.
  AMIENS. And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.
                                                Exeunt nombreusesly

The for√™t

Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

  ADAM. Dear master, I can go no plus,loin. O, I die for food! Here lie
    I down, and mesure out my la,tombe. Farewell, kind master.
  ORLANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No g√©nialeer c≈ìur in thee? Live a
    peu; confort a peu; acclamation thyself a peu. If this uncouth
    for√™t rendement n'importe,quoi savage, I will Soit be food for it or
    apporter it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer d√©c√®s than thy
    Puissances. For my sake be confortable; hold d√©c√®s quelque,temps at the
    arm's end. I will here be with the pr√©sentely; and if I apporter thee
    not quelque,chose to eat, I will give thee laisser to die; but if thou
    diest avant I come, thou art a mocker of my la,main,d'oeuvre. Well said!
    thou look'st acclamationly; and I'll be with thee rapidely. Yet thou
    liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter;
    and thou shalt not die for lack of a d√Æner, if L√ live
    n'importe,quoi in this d√©serte. Cheerly, good Adam!          Exeunt




SCENE VII.
The for√™t

A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws

  DUKE SENIOR. I pense he be transform'd into a la,b√™te;
    For I can noo√π find him like a man.
  FIRST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone Par,cons√©quent;
    Here was he joyeux, hearing of a song.
  DUKE SENIOR. If he, compact of jars, grow la,musiqueal,
    We doit have tribunalely discord in the spheres.
    Go seek him; tell him I aurait parler with him.

                         Enter JAQUES

  FIRST LORD. He saves my la,main,d'oeuvre by his own approche.
  DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
    That your poor amies must woo your entreprise?
    What, you look merrily!
  JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' for√™t,
    A motley fool. A miserable monde!
    As I do live by food, I met a fool,
    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good termes,
    In good set termes- and yet a motley fool.
    'Good demain, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,
    'Call me not fool till paradis hath sent me fortune.'
    And then he drew a dial from his poke,
    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;
    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the monde wags;
    'Tis but an hour ago depuis it was nine;
    And apr√®s one hour more 'twill be eleven;
    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
    And L√by bloque a tale.' When I did hear
    The motley fool thus moral on the time,
    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
    That imb√©ciles devrait be so deep contemplative;
    And I did rire sans intermission
    An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
    A vauty fool! Motley's the only wear.
  DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?
  JAQUES. O vauty fool! One that hath been a tribunalier,
    And says, if Dames be but Jeune and fair,
    They have the gift to know it; and in his cerveau,
    Which is as dry as the resterder biscuit
    After a voyage, he hath √©trange endroits cramm'd
    With observation, the laquelle he vents
    In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
    I am ambitious for a motley coat.
  DUKE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.
  JAQUES. It is my only suit,
    Provided that you weed your better jugements
    Of all opinion that grows rank in them
    That I am wise. I must have libert√©
    Withal, as grande a charter as the wind,
    To blow on whom I S'il,vous,pla√Æt, for so imb√©ciles have;
    And they that are most galled with my folie,
    They most must rire. And why, sir, must they so?
    The why is plaineee as way to Parish √©glise:
    He that a fool doth very wisely hit
    Doth very insens√©ely, bien,que he smart,
    Not to seem sensless of the bob; if not,
    The wise man's folie is anatomiz'd
    Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.
    Invest me in my motley; give me laisser
    To parler my mind, and I will thrugueux and thrugueux
    Cleanse the foul body of th' infected monde,
    If they will patienteeely recevoir my medicine.
  DUKE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou auraitst do.
  JAQUES. What, for a compterer, aurait I do but good?
  DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
    For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
    As sensual as the brutish sting lui-m√™me;
    And all th' embossed sores and headed evils
    That thou with license of free foot hast caught
    Wouldst thou disgorge into the g√©n√©rale monde.
  JAQUES. Why, who cries out on fiert√©
    That can L√in tax any priv√©e f√™te?
    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
    Till that the wearer's very veux,dire do ebb?
    What femme in the city do I name
    When that I say the city-femme le,baissier
    The cost of princes on indigne devraiters?
    Who can come in and say that I mean her,
    When such a one as she such is her voisine?
    Or what is he of basest function
    That says his courageusery is not on my cost,
    Thinking that I mean him, but L√in suits
    His folie to the mettle of my discours?
    There then! how then? what then? Let me see o√πin
    My langue hath faux'd him: if it do him droite,
    Then he hath faux'd himself; if he be free,
    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose mouches,
    Unpr√©tendre'd of any man. But who vient here?

             Enter ORLANDO with his √©p√©e tir√©e

  ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.
  JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet.
  ORLANDO. Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
  JAQUES. Of what kind devrait this cock come of?
  DUKE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
    Or else a rude despiser of good mani√®res,
    That in civileeeity thou seem'st so vide?
  ORLANDO. You touchererer'd my vein at premi√®re: the thorny point
    Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
    Of smooth civileeeity; yet arn I inland bred,
    And know some nurture. But anc√™tre, I say;
    He dies that toucherereres any of this fruit
    Till I and my affaires are r√©pondreed.
  JAQUES. An you will not be r√©pondre'd with raison, I must die.
  DUKE SENIOR. What aurait you have? Your douceness doit Obliger
    More than your Obliger move us to douceness.
  ORLANDO. I presque die for food, and let me have it.
  DUKE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and Bienvenue to our table.
  ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
    I bien,quet that all choses had been savage here,
    And L√fore put I on the compterenance
    Of stern commanderererment. But whate'er you are
    That in this d√©serte inaccessible,
    Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
    Lose and neglect the creeping heures of time;
    If ever you have look'd on better days,
    If ever been o√π bells have knoll'd to √©glise,
    If ever sat at any good man's le,banquet,
    If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
    And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
    Let douceness my forte enObligerment be;
    In the laquelle hope I rougir, and hide my √©p√©e.
  DUKE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,
    And have with holy bell been knoll'd to √©glise,
    And sat at good men's le,banquets, and wip'd our eyes
    Of gouttes that sacr√©e pity hath engend'red;
    And L√fore sit you down in douceness,
    And take upon commandererer what help we have
    That to your wanting may be minist'red.
  ORLANDO. Then but anc√™tre your food a peu tandis,que,
    Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
    And give it food. There is an old poor man
    Who apr√®s me hath many a se,lasser step
    Limp'd in pure love; till he be premi√®re suffic'd,
    Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
    I will not touchererer a bit.
  DUKE SENIOR. Go find him out.
    And we will rien d√©chets till you revenir.
  ORLANDO. I remercier ye; and be heureuse for your good confort!
 Exit
  DUKE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all seule unheureuse:
    This wide and universal theatre
    Presents more woeful pageants than the sc√®ne
    Wherein we play in.
  JAQUES. All the monde's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have leur exits and leur entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many les,pi√®ces,
    His acts √©tant Sept ages. At premi√®re the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the infirmi√®re's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining Matin face, creeping like snail
    Unpr√™tely to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his ma√Ætresse' eyebrow. Then a soldate,
    Full of √©trange serments, and barbeed like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, soudaine and rapide in querelle,
    Seeking the bubble r√©putation
    Even in the cannon's bouche. And then the Justice,
    In fair ronde belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and barbe of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His jeunesseful hose, well sav'd, a monde too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voix,
    Turning encore vers enfantish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his du,son. Last sc√®ne of all,
    That ends this √©trange eventful hir√©cit,
    Is secondeee enfantishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans les,dents, sans eyes, sans go√ªt, sans chaque chose.

                  Re-entrer ORLANDO with ADAM

  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable fardeau.
    And let him feed.
  ORLANDO. I remercier you most for him.
  ADAM. So had you need;
    I rare can parler to remercier you for moi,m√™me.
  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome; fall to. I will not difficult√© you
    As yet to question you √,propos your fortunes.
    Give us some la,musique; and, good cousineee, sing.

                         SONG
            Blow, blow, thou hiver wind,
            Thou art not so unkind
              As man's ingratitude;
            Thy tooth is not so keen,
            Because thou art not seen,
              Albien,que thy souffle be rude.
    Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the verte holly.
    Most amieship is feigning, most aimante mere folie.
            Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
              This life is most jolly.

            Freeze, freeze, thou am√®re sky,
            That dost not bite so nigh
              As aaaavantages forgot;
            Though thou the eaus warp,
            Thy sting is not so tranchante
              As amie rememb'red not.
    Heigh-ho! sing, &c.

  DUKE SENIOR. If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
    As you have whisper'd Foifully you were,
    And as mine eye doth his effigies t√©moin
    Most vraiment limn'd and vivante in your face,
    Be vraiment Bienvenue hither. I am the Duke
    That lov'd your p√®re. The residue of your fortune,
    Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
    Thou art droite Bienvenue as thy master is.
    Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
    And let me all your fortunes soussupporter.              Exeunt




ACT III. SCENE I.
The palais

Enter DUKE FREDERICK, OLIVER, and LORDS

  FREDERICK. Not see him depuis! Sir, sir, that ne,peux,pas be.
    But were I not the better part made piti√©,
    I devrait not seek an absent argument
    Of my vengeance, thou pr√©sente. But look to it:
    Find out thy fr√®re o√πsoe'er he is;
    Seek him with candle; apporter him dead or vivante
    Within this twelvemois, or turn thou no more
    To seek a vivante in our territory.
    Thy terres and all choses that thou dost call thine
    Worth seizure do we seize into our mains,
    Till thou canst quit thee by thy fr√®re's bouche
    Of what we pense encorest thee.
  OLIVER. O that your Highness knew my c≈ìur in this!
    I jamais lov'd my fr√®re in my life.
  FREDERICK. More sc√©l√©rat thou. Well, push him out of des,portes;
    And let my Bureaurs of such a la,la,la,nature
    Make an extent upon his maison and terres.
    Do this expediently, and turn him Aller.              Exeunt




SCENE II.
The for√™t

Enter ORLANDO, with a papier

  ORLANDO. Hang L√, my verse, in t√©moin of my love;
    And thou, thrice-couronneed Queen of Night, survey
    With thy ch√¢te eye, from thy pale sphere au,dessus,
    Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
    O Rosalind! celles-ci trees doit be my books,
    And in leur barks my bien,quets I'll character,
    That chaque eye laquelle in this for√™t looks
    Shall see thy vertu t√©moin'd chaque o√π.
    Run, run, Orlando; carve on chaque tree,
    The fair, the ch√¢te, and unexpressive she.             Exit

                     Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

  CORIN. And how like you this berg√®re's life, Master Touchcalcul?
  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, berg√®re, in le,le,le,respect of lui-m√™me, it is a good
    life; but in le,le,le,respect that it is a berg√®re's life, it is n√©ant.
    In le,le,le,respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in
    le,le,le,respect that it is priv√©e, it is a very vile life. Now in
    le,le,le,respect it is in the champs, it S'il,vous,pla√Ætth me well; but in le,le,le,respect
    it is not in the tribunal, it is fastidieuse. As it is a de,rechangementment life,
    look you, it fits my humour well; but as L√ is no more plenty
    in it, it goes much encorest my estomac. Hast any philosophy in
    thee, berg√®re?
  CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the pire at
    ease he is; and that he that wants argent, veux,dire, and contenu, is
    sans,pour,autant three good amies; that the correctety of rain is to wet,
    and fire to burn; that good pasture fait,du fat sheep; and that a
    g√©niale cause of the nuit is lack of the sun; that he that hath
    apprendreed no wit by la,la,la,nature nor art may complaineee of good raceing,
    or vient of a very dull kindred.
  TOUCHSTONE. Such a one is a la,la,la,naturelle philosopher. Wast ever in
    tribunal, berg√®re?
  CORIN. No, vraiment.
  TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.
  CORIN. Nay, I hope.
  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
    one side.
  CORIN. For not √©tant at tribunal? Your raison.
  TOUCHSTONE. Why, if thou jamais wast at tribunal thou jamais saw'st good
    mani√®res; if thou jamais saw'st good mani√®res, then thy mani√®res must
    be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art
    in a parlous Etat, berg√®re.
  CORIN. Not a whit, Touchcalcul. Those that are good mani√®res at the
    tribunal are as ridiculous in the compterry as the behaviour of the
    compterry is most mockable at the tribunal. You told me you salute not
    at the tribunal, but you kiss your mains; that tribunalesy aurait be
    oncleanly if tribunaliers were berg√®res.
  TOUCHSTONE. Instance, br√®vely; come, instance.
  CORIN. Why, we are encore handling our ewes; and leur fells, you
    know, are greasy.
  TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your tribunalier's mains transpiration? And is not the
    grease of a mutton as enti√®resome as the transpiration of a man? Shallow,
    doitow. A better instance, I say; come.
  CORIN. Besides, our mains are hard.
  TOUCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the plus,t√¥t. Shallow encore. A
    more du,soner instance; come.
  CORIN. And they are souvent tarr'd over with the surgery of our
    sheep; and aurait you have us kiss tar? The tribunalier's mains are
    perfum'd with civet.
  TOUCHSTONE. Most doitow man! thou worm's meat in le,le,le,respect of a good
    pi√®ce of la,chaise En,effet! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is
    of a baser naissance than tar- the very oncleanly flux of a cat. Mend
    the instance, berg√®re.
  CORIN. You have too tribunally a wit for me; I'll rest.
  TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, doitow man! God
    make incision in thee! thou art raw.
  CORIN. Sir, I am a true la,main,d'oeuvreer: I earn that I eat, get that I
    wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's bonheur; glad of autre
    men's good, contenu with my harm; and the g√©nialeest of my fiert√© is
    to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
  TOUCHSTONE. That is un,autre Facile sin in you: to apporter the ewes
    and the rams ensemble, and to offre to get your vivante by the
    copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to trahir
    a she-lamb of a twelvemois to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
    out of all raisonable rencontre. If thou beest not damn'd for this,
    the diable himself will have no berg√®res; I ne,peux,pas see else how
    thou devraitst scape.
  CORIN. Here vient Jeune Master Ganymede, my new ma√Ætresse's fr√®re.

                  Enter ROSALIND, reading a papier

  ROSALIND.   'From the east to western Inde,
              No bijou is like Rosalinde.
              Her vaut, √©tant mounted on the wind,
              Thrugueux all the monde le,baissier Rosalinde.
              All the images fairest lin'd
              Are but noir to Rosalinde.
              Let no face be kept in mind
              But the fair of Rosalinde.'
  TOUCHSTONE. I'll rhyme you so eight years ensemble, d√Æners, and
    soupers, and dormiring heures, saufed. It is the droite
    bprononcer-women's rank to market.
  ROSALIND. Out, fool!
  TOUCHSTONE.   For a go√ªt:
                If a hart do lack a hind,
                Let him seek out Rosalinde.
                If the cat will apr√®s kind,
                So be sure will Rosalinde.
                Winter garments must be lin'd,
                So must mince Rosalinde.
                They that reap must sheaf and bind,
                Then to cart with Rosalinde.
                Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
                Such a nut is Rosalinde.
                He that sucr√©est rose will find
                Must find love's prick and Rosalinde.
    This is the very faux gallop of verses; why do you infect
    le,tienself with them?
  ROSALIND. Peace, you dull fool! I a,trouv√© them on a tree.
  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, the tree rendements bad fruit.
  ROSALIND. I'll graff it with you, and then I doit graff it with a
    medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' compterry; for
    you'll be pourrie ere you be half ripe, and that's the droite
    vertu of the medlar.
  TOUCHSTONE. You have said; but qu'il,s'agisse wisely or no, let the for√™t
    juge.

                      Enter CELIA, with a writing

  ROSALIND. Peace!
    Here vient my s≈ìur, reading; supporter de,c√¥t√©.
  CELIA.   'Why devrait this a d√©serte be?
             For it is ungensd? No;
           Tongues I'll hang on chaque tree
             That doit civileee en,disants show.
           Some, how br√®ve the life of man
             Runs his erring pilgrimage,
           That the streching of a span
             Buckles in his sum of age;
           Some, of altoted vows
             'Twixt the √¢mes of amie and amie;
           But upon the fairest boughs,
             Or at chaque phrase end,
           Will I Rosalinda √©crire,
             Teaching all that read to know
           The quintessence of chaque sprite
             Heaven aurait in peu show.
           Therefore paradis Nature charg'd
             That one body devrait be fill'd
           With all la,gr√¢ces wide-enlarg'd.
             Nature pr√©sentely diencore'd
           Helen's joue, but not her c≈ìur,
             Cleopatra's majest√©,
           Atalanta's better part,
             Sad Lucretia's modesteeey.
           Thus Rosalinde of many les,pi√®ces
             By paradisly synod was devis'd,
           Of many visages, eyes, and c≈ìurs,
             To have the toucherereres tr√®s,cher priz'd.
           Heaven aurait that she celles-ci gifts devrait have,
           And I to live and die her esclave.'
  ROSALIND. O most douce pulpiter! What fastidieuse homily of love have
    you wearied your Parishioners avec, and jamais cried 'Have
    la,la,la,patience, good gens.'
  CELIA. How now! Back, amies; berg√®re, go off a peu; go with
    him, sirrah.
  TOUCHSTONE. Come, berg√®re, let us make an honourable retreat;
    bien,que not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
                                     Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
  CELIA. Didst thou hear celles-ci verses?
  ROSALIND. O, yes, I entendue them all, and more too; for some of them
    had in them more feet than the verses aurait bear.
  CELIA. That's no mati√®re; the feet pourrait bear the verses.
  ROSALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and pourrait not bear se
    sans,pour,autant the verse, and L√fore se,tenait lamely in the verse.
  CELIA. But didst thou hear sans,pour,autant merveilleing how thy name devrait be
    hang'd and carved upon celles-ci trees?
  ROSALIND. I was Sept of the nine days out of the merveille avant you
    came; for look here what I a,trouv√© on a palm-tree. I was jamais so
    berhym'd depuis Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat, laquelle I
    can hardly rappelles,toi.
  CELIA. Trow you who hath done this?
  ROSALIND. Is it a man?
  CELIA. And a cha√Æne, that you once wore, √,propos his neck.
    Change you Couleur?
  ROSALIND. I prithee, who?
  CELIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard mati√®re for amies to meet; but
    mountains may be remov'd with Terrequakes, and so encompterer.
  ROSALIND. Nay, but who is it?
  CELIA. Is it possible?
  ROSALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
    me who it is.
  CELIA. O merveilleful, merveilleful, most merveilleful merveilleful, and yet
    encore merveilleful, and apr√®s that, out of all whooping!
  ROSALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou pense, bien,que I am
    caParison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my
    disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of d√©couvriry.
    I prithee tell me who is it rapidely, and parler apace. I aurait
    thou pourrait'st stammer, that thou pourraitst pour this conceal'd man
    out of thy bouche, as wine vient out of narrow-bouche'd bottle-
    Soit too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork
    out of thy bouche that I may boisson thy tidings.
  CELIA. So you may put a man in your belly.
  ROSALIND. Is he of God's fabrication? What mani√®re of man?
    Is his head vaut a hat or his chin vaut a barbe?
  CELIA. Nay, he hath but a peu barbe.
  ROSALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be remercierful. Let
    me stay the growth of his barbe, if thou delay me not the
    connaissance of his chin.
  CELIA. It is Jeune Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's talons
    and your c≈ìur both in an instant.
  ROSALIND. Nay, but the diable take mocking! Speak sad brow and true
    maid.
  CELIA. I' Foi, coz, 'tis he.
  ROSALIND. Orlando?
  CELIA. Orlando.
  ROSALIND. Alas the day! what doit I do with my doublet and hose?
    What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?
    Wherein went he? What fait,du he here? Did he ask for me? Where
    resters he? How s√©par√©e he with thee? And when shalt thou see him
    encore? Answer me in one word.
  CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's bouche premi√®re; 'tis a word too
    g√©niale for any bouche of this age's size. To say ay and no to celles-ci
    particuli√®res is more than to r√©pondre in a catechism.
  ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this for√™t, and in man's
    v√™tements? Looks he as fra√Æchely as he did the day he wrestled?
  CELIA. It is as easy to compter atomies as to resolve the
    propositions of a lover; but take a go√ªt of my finding him, and
    relish it with good observance. I a,trouv√© him sous a tree, like a
    dropp'd acorn.
  ROSALIND. It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it gouttes en,avant
    such fruit.
  CELIA. Give me audience, good madam.
  ROSALIND. Proceed.
  CELIA. There lay he, stretch'd le,long,de like a b√©nirureed Chevalier.
  ROSALIND. Though it be pity to see such a vue, it well bevient
    the sol.
  CELIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy langue, I prithee; it curvets
    unsaisonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.
  ROSALIND. O, ominous! he vient to kill my c≈ìur.
  CELIA. I aurait sing my song sans,pour,autant a fardeau; thou apporter'st me out
    of tune.
  ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a femme? When I pense, I must parler.
    Sweet, say on.
  CELIA. You apporter me out. Soft! vient he not here?

                   Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES

  ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
  JAQUES. I remercier you for your entreprise; but, good Foi, I had as
    lief have been moi,m√™me seule.
  ORLANDO. And so had I; but yet, for mode sake, I remercier you too
    for your society.
  JAQUES. God buy you; let's meet as peu as we can.
  ORLANDO. I do le,d√©sir we may be better strcol√®res.
  JAQUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
    leur barks.
  ORLANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
    ill-favoriseredly.
  JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name?
  ORLANDO. Yes, just.
  JAQUES. I do not like her name.
  ORLANDO. There was no bien,quet of pleasing you when she was
    christen'd.
  JAQUES. What stature is she of?
  ORLANDO. Just as high as my c≈ìur.
  JAQUES. You are full of jolie r√©pondres. Have you not been
    connaissance with goldsmiths' √©pouses, and conn'd them out of rings?
  ORLANDO. Not so; but I r√©pondre you droite peinte cloth, from wPar,cons√©quent
    you have studied your questions.
  JAQUES. You have a nimble wit; I pense 'twas made of Atalanta's
    talons. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail encorest
    our ma√Ætresse the monde, and all our mis√®re.
  ORLANDO. I will gronder no souffleer in the monde but moi,m√™me, encorest
    whom I know most fautes.
  JAQUES. The worst faute you have is to be in love.
  ORLANDO. 'Tis a faute I will not changementmentment for your best vertu. I am
    se,lasser of you.
  JAQUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I a,trouv√© you.
  ORLANDO. He is noyer'd in the ruisseau; look but in, and you doit see
    him.
  JAQUES. There I doit see mine own figure.
  ORLANDO. Which I take to be Soit a fool or a cipher.
  JAQUES. I'll goudronneuse no lus,long with you; adieu, good Signior Love.
  ORLANDO. I am glad of your partirure; adieu, good Monsieur
    Melancholy.
                                                     Exit JAQUES
  ROSALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will parler to him like a saucy lackey,
    and sous that habitudeudeude play the friponne with him.- Do you hear,
    for√™ter?
  ORLANDO. Very well; what aurait you?
  ROSALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
  ORLANDO. You devrait ask me what time o' day; L√'s no clock in
    the for√™t.
  ROSALIND. Then L√ is no true lover in the for√™t, else sighing
    chaque minute and groaning chaque hour aurait detect the lazy foot
    of Time as well as a clock.
  ORLANDO. And why not the rapide foot of Time? Had not that been as
    correcte?
  ROSALIND. By no veux,dire, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
    divers la,la,la,personnenenes. I'll tell you who Time ambles avec, who Time
    trots avec, who Time gallops avec, and who he supporters encore
    avec.
  ORLANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot avec?
  ROSALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a Jeune maid entre the
    contract of her mariage and the day it is solennelleiz'd; if the
    interim be but a se'nnuit, Time's pace is so hard that it seems
    the length of Sept year.
  ORLANDO. Who ambles Time avec?
  ROSALIND. With a pr√™tresse that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
    not the gout; for the one dormirs easily parce,que he ne,peux,pas √©tude,
    and the autre vies merrily parce,que he feels no pain; the one
    lacking the fardeau of lean and d√©chetsful apprendreing, the autre
    connaissance no fardeau of lourde fastidieuse penury. These Time ambles
    avec.
  ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop avec?
  ROSALIND. With a voleuse to the gallows; for bien,que he go as softly
    as foot can fall, he penses himself too soon L√.
  ORLANDO. Who stays it encore avec?
  ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they dormir entre term
    and term, and then they apercevoir not how Time moves.
  ORLANDO. Where habitudeudeudeer you, jolie jeunesse?
  ROSALIND. With this berg√®reess, my s≈ìur; here in the skirts of
    the for√™t, like fringe upon a petticoat.
  ORLANDO. Are you originaire,de of this endroit?
  ROSALIND. As the coney that you see habitudeudeudeer o√π she is kindled.
  ORLANDO. Your accent is quelque,chose finer than you pourrait purchase in
    so removed a habitudeudeudeering.
  ROSALIND. I have been told so of many; but En,effet an old religious
    oncle of mine enseign√©e me to parler, who was in his jeunesse an inland
    man; one that knew tribunalship too well, for L√ he fell in love.
    I have entendue him read many lectures encorest it; and I remercier God I
    am not a femme, to be touchererer'd with so many giddy infractions as he
    hath g√©n√©ralely tax'd leur enti√®re sex avec.
  ORLANDO. Can you rappelles,toi any of the principal evils that he laid
    to the charge of women?
  ROSALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one un,autre
    as halfpence are; chaque one faute seeming monstrous till his
    compagne-faute came to rencontre it.
  ORLANDO. I prithee recompter some of them.
  ROSALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on celles that are
    sick. There is a man haunts the for√™t that abuser,der,der,des our Jeune
    plants with carving 'Rosalind' on leur barks; bloque odes upon
    hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, en,v√©rit√©, deifying the
    name of Rosalind. If I pourrait meet that fantaisie-monger, I aurait give
    him some good Conseil, for he seems to have the quotidian of love
    upon him.
  ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
    rem√®de.
  ROSALIND. There is none of my oncle's marks upon you; he enseign√©e me
    how to know a man in love; in laquelle cage of rushes I am sure you
    are not prisoner.
  ORLANDO. What were his marks?
  ROSALIND. A lean joue, laquelle you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
    laquelle you have not; an unquestionable esprit, laquelle you have not;
    a barbe neglected, laquelle you have not; but I pardon you for that,
    for simply your ayant in barbe is a Jeuneer fr√®re's revenue.
    Then your hose devrait be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your
    sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and chaque chose √,propos you
    demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you
    are plut√¥t point-dispositif in your accoutrements, as aimante le,tienself
    than seeming the lover of any autre.
  ORLANDO. Fair jeunesse, I aurait I pourrait make thee croyez I love.
  ROSALIND. Me croyez it! You may as soon make her that you love
    croyez it; laquelle, I mandat, she is apter to do than to confess
    she does. That is one of the points in the laquelle women encore give
    the lie to leur consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that
    bloque the verses on the trees o√πin Rosalind is so admired?
  ORLANDO. I jurer to thee, jeunesse, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
    am that he, that unfortunate he.
  ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes parler?
  ORLANDO. NSoit rhyme nor raison can express how much.
  ROSALIND. Love is merely a la,d√©mence; and, I tell you, m√©riters as
    well a dark maison and a whip as madmen do; and the raison why
    they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
    ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing
    it by Conseil.
  ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
  ROSALIND. Yes, one; and in this mani√®re. He was to imagine me his
    love, his ma√Ætresse; and I set him chaque day to woo me; at laquelle
    time aurait I, √©tant but a moonish jeunesse, pleurer, be effeminate,
    changementmentmentable, longing and liking, fi√®re, fantastical, apish,
    doitow, inconstanteee, full of larmes, full of sourires; for chaque
    la,la,la,passion quelque,chose and for no la,la,la,passion vraiment n'importe,quoi, as boys and
    women are for the most part cattle of this Couleur; aurait now like
    him, now loathe him; then entrertain him, then forjurer him; now
    weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his
    mad humour of love to a vivante humour of la,d√©mence; laquelle was, to
    forjurer the full stream of the monde and to live in a nook
    merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take
    upon me to wash your liver as clean as a du,son sheep's c≈ìur,
    that L√ doit not be one spot of love in 't.
  ORLANDO. I aurait not be cured, jeunesse.
  ROSALIND. I aurait cure you, if you aurait but call me Rosalind, and
    come chaque day to my cote and woo me.
  ORLANDO. Now, by the Foi of my love, I will. Tell me o√π it is.
  ROSALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
    you doit tell me o√π in the for√™t you live. Will you go?
  ORLANDO. With all my c≈ìur, good jeunesse.
  ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, s≈ìur, will you
    go?                                                   Exeunt




SCENE III.
The for√™t

Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES derri√®re

  TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will chercher up your goats,
    Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my Facile feature
    contenu you?
  AUDREY. Your features! Lord mandat us! What features?
  TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
    capricious poet, honn√™te Ovid, was among the Goths.
  JAQUES. [Aside] O connaissance ill-inhabitudeudeudeed, pire than Jove in a
    thatch'd maison!
  TOUCHSTONE. When a man's verses ne,peux,pas be sousse,tenait, nor a man's
    good wit secondeeeed with the forward enfant soussupportering, it
    la,gr√®ves a man more dead than a g√©niale reckoning in a peu room.
    Truly, I aurait the gods had made thee poetical.
  AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honn√™te in deed and
    word? Is it a true chose?
  TOUCHSTONE. No, vraiment; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
    and les,amoureux are donn√©e to poetry; and what they jurer in poetry may
    be said as les,amoureux they do feign.
  AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
  TOUCHSTONE. I do, vraiment, for thou jurer'st to me thou art honn√™te;
    now, if thou wert a poet, I pourrait have some hope thou didst
    feign.
  AUDREY. Would you not have me honn√™te?
  TOUCHSTONE. No, vraiment, sauf,si thou wert hard-favoriser'd; for honn√™tey
    coupled to beaut√© is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
  JAQUES. [Aside] A material fool!
  AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and L√fore I pray the gods make me
    honn√™te.
  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honn√™tey upon a foul slut were
    to put good meat into an onclean dish.
  AUDREY. I am not a slut, bien,que I remercier the gods I am foul.
  TOUCHSTONE. Well, louanged be the gods for thy foulness;
    sluttishness may come hereapr√®s. But be it as it may be, I will
    ma√Ætresse thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext,
    the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in
    this endroit of the for√™t, and to couple us.
  JAQUES. [Aside] I aurait fain see this r√©union.
  AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!
  TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a craintive c≈ìur, stagger
    in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no
    assembly but horn-la,b√™tes. But what bien,que? Courage! As horns are
    odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man sait no end
    of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and sait no end
    of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
    own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men seule? No, no; the noheureuse
    deer hath them as huge as the coquine. Is the C√©libataire man L√fore
    b√©nired? No; as a wall'd town is more vautier than a village, so
    is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
    brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
    comp√©tence, by so much is horn more pr√©cieuse than to want. Here vient
    Sir Oliver.

                       Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

    Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you envoi us here
    sous this tree, or doit we go with you to your chapel?
  MARTEXT. Is L√ none here to give the femme?
  TOUCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.
  MARTEXT. Truly, she must be donn√©e, or the mariage is not l√©gitime.
  JAQUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proc√©der; I'll give her.
  TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
    You are very well met. Goddild you for your last entreprise. I am
    very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be
    cover'd.
  JAQUES. Will you be married, motley?
  TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the jument his curb, and
    the falcon her bells, so man hath his le,d√©sirs; and as pigeons
    bill, so wedlock aurait be nibbling.
  JAQUES. And will you, √©tant a man of your raceing, be married
    sous a bush, like a gueux? Get you to √©glise and have a good
    pr√™tresse that can tell you what mariage is; this compagne will but
    join you ensemble as they join wainscot; then one of you will
    prouver a shrunk panel, and like verte timber warp, warp.
  TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
    married of him than of un,autre; for he is not like to ma√Ætresse me
    well; and not √©tant well married, it will be a good excuse for me
    hereapr√®s to laisser my wife.
  JAQUES. Go thou with me, and let me Conseil thee.
  TOUCHSTONE. Come, sucr√© Audrey;
    We must be married or we must live in bawdry.
    Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not-
               O sucr√© Oliver,
               O courageuse Oliver,
           Leave me not derri√®re thee.
    But-
                 Wind away,
               Begone, I say,
           I will not to wedding with thee.
                           Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY
  MARTEXT. 'Tis no mati√®re; ne'er a fantastical friponne of them all
    doit flout me out of my calling.                       Exit




SCENE IV.
The for√™t

Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

  ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.
  CELIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the la,gr√¢ce to consid√©rer that larmes
    do not become a man.
  ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?
  CELIA. As good cause as one aurait le,d√©sir; L√fore weep.
  ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling Couleur.
  CELIA. Somechose browner than Judas's.
    Marry, his kisses are Judas's own enfantren.
  ROSALIND. I' Foi, his hair is of a good Couleur.
  CELIA. An excellenteee Couleur: your chestnut was ever the only Couleur.
  ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touchererer of
    holy bread.
  CELIA. He hath achet√©e a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
    hiver's s≈ìurhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of
    chastity is in them.
  ROSALIND. But why did he jurer he aurait come this Matin, and
    vient not?
  CELIA. Nay, certaineeely, L√ is no v√©rit√© in him.
  ROSALIND. Do you pense so?
  CELIA. Yes; I pense he is not a pick-bourse nor a jument-volerer; but
    for his verity in love, I do pense him as concave as covered
    goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
  ROSALIND. Not true in love?
  CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I pense he is not in.
  ROSALIND. You have entendue him jurer downdroite he was.
  CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; outre, the oath of a lover is no
    forteer than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer
    of faux reckonings. He ass≈ìurs here in the for√™t on the Duke,
    your p√®re.
  ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
    He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as
    he; so he rire'd and let me go. But what talk we of p√®res when
    L√ is such a man as Orlando?
  CELIA. O, that's a courageuse man! He √©crires courageuse verses, parlers courageuse
    words, jurers courageuse serments, and breaks them courageusely, assez
    traverse, athwart the c≈ìur of his lover; as a puny tilter, that
    spurs his jument but on one side, breaks his la,la,personnenenelle like a noble
    goose. But all's courageuse that jeunesse mounts and folie guides. Who
    vient here?

                         Enter CORIN

  CORIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
    After the berg√®re that complaineee'd of love,
    Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
    Praising the fi√®re disdainful berg√®reess
    That was his ma√Ætresse.
  CELIA. Well, and what of him?
  CORIN. If you will see a pageant vraiment play'd
    Between the pale complexion of true love
    And the red glow of m√©pris and fi√®re disdain,
    Go Par,cons√©quent a peu, and I doit conduite you,
    If you will mark it.
  ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove!
    The vue of les,amoureux feedeth celles in love.
    Bring us to this vue, and you doit say
    I'll prouver a busy actor in leur play.                Exeunt




SCENE V.
Anautre part of the for√™t

Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE

  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not m√©pris me; do not, Phebe.
    Say that you love me not; but say not so
    In am√®reness. The commune ex√©cutioner,
    Whose c≈ìur th' acDouane'd vue of d√©c√®s fait,du hard,
    Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
    But premi√®re begs pardon. Will you sterner be
    Than he that dies and vies by du,sangy gouttes?

          Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance

  PHEBE. I aurait not be thy ex√©cutioner;
    I fly thee, for I aurait not injure thee.
    Thou tell'st me L√ is meurtre in mine eye.
    'Tis jolie, sure, and very probable,
    That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest choses,
    Who shut leur l√¢che portes on atomies,
    Should be call'd tyrans, butchers, meurtreers!
    Now I do froncer,les,sourcils on thee with all my c≈ìur;
    And if mine eyes can b√©nirure, now let them kill thee.
    Now comptererfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;
    Or, if thou canst not, O, for la,honte, for la,honte,
    Lie not, to say mine eyes are meurtreers.
    Now show the b√©nirure mine eye hath made in thee.
    Scratch thee but with a pin, and L√ resters
    Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,
    The cicatrice and capable impressure
    Thy palm some moment garde; but now mine eyes,
    Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;
    Nor, I am sure, L√ is not Obliger in eyes
    That can do hurt.
  SILVIUS. O dear Phebe,
    If ever- as that ever may be near-
    You meet in some fra√Æche joue the Puissance of fantaisie,
    Then doit you know the b√©nirures invisible
    That love's keen arrows make.
  PHEBE. But till that time
    Come not thou near me; and when that time vient,
    Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
    As till that time I doit not pity thee.
  ROSALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who pourrait be your
      m√®re,
    That you insult, exult, and all at once,
    Over the mis√©rableed? What bien,que you have no beaut√©-
    As, by my Foi, I see no more in you
    Than sans,pour,autant candle may go dark to bed-
    Must you be L√fore fi√®re and pitiless?
    Why, what veux,dire this? Why do you look on me?
    I see no more in you than in the ordinary
    Of la,la,la,nature's sale-work. 'Od's my peu life,
    I pense she veux,dire to tangle my eyes too!
    No Foi, fi√®re ma√Ætresse, hope not apr√®s it;
    'Tis not your inky sourcils, your noir silk hair,
    Your bugle eyeballs, nor your joue of cream,
    That can entame my esprits to your culte.
    You insens√©e berg√®re, o√πfore do you suivre her,
    Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
    You are a thousand fois a correcteer man
    Than she a femme. 'Tis such imb√©ciles as you
    That fait,du the monde full of ill-favoriser'd enfantren.
    'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
    And out of you she sees se more correcte
    Than any of her lineaments can show her.
    But, ma√Ætresse, know le,tienself. Down on your les,genoux,
    And remercier paradis, fasting, for a good man's love;
    For I must tell you amiely in your ear:
    Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
    Cry the man piti√©, love him, take his offre;
    Foul is most foul, √©tant foul to be a scoffre.
    So take her to thee, berg√®re. Fare you well.
  PHEBE. Sweet jeunesse, I pray you gronder a year ensemble;
    I had plut√¥t hear you gronder than this man woo.
  ROSALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
    in love with my col√®re. If it be so, as fast as she r√©pondres thee
    with froncer,les,sourcilsing looks, I'll sauce her with am√®re words. Why look
    you so upon me?
  PHEBE. For no ill will I bear you.
  ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,
    For I am fauxr than vows made in wine;
    Besides, I like you not. If you will know my maison,
    'Tis at the tuft of ovies here hard by.
    Will you go, s≈ìur? Shepherd, ply her hard.
    Come, s≈ìur. Shepherdess, look on him better,
    And be not fi√®re; bien,que all the monde pourrait see,
    None pourrait be so abus'd in vue as he.
    Come, to our flock.        Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN
  PHEBE. Dead berg√®re, now I find thy saw of pourrait:
    'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at premi√®re vue?'
  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe.
  PHEBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
  PHEBE. Why, I arn Pardon for thee, douce Silvius.
  SILVIUS. Wherever chagrin is, relief aurait be.
    If you do chagrin at my douleur in love,
    By donnant love, your chagrin and my douleur
    Were both extermin'd.
  PHEBE. Thou hast my love; is not that voisinely?
  SILVIUS. I aurait have you.
  PHEBE. Why, that were covetousness.
    Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
    And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
    But depuis that thou canst talk of love so well,
    Thy entreprise, laquelle erst was irksome to me,
    I will supporter; and I'll employ thee too.
    But do not look for plus,loin recompense
    Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
  SILVIUS. So holy and so parfaite is my love,
    And I in such a poverty of la,gr√¢ce,
    That I doit pense it a most plenteous crop
    To glean the cass√©en ears apr√®s the man
    That the main harvest reaps; ample now and then
    A scatt'red sourire, and that I'll live upon.
  PHEBE. Know'st thou the jeunesse that parlait to me eretandis,que?
  SILVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
    And he hath achet√©e the cottage and the li√©es
    That the old carlot once was master of.
  PHEBE. Think not I love him, bien,que I ask for him;
    'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.
    But what care I for words? Yet words do well
    When he that parlers them S'il,vous,pla√Æts celles that hear.
    It is a jolie jeunesse- not very jolie;
    But, sure, he's fi√®re; and yet his fiert√© bevient him.
    He'll make a correcte man. The best chose in him
    Is his complexion; and faster than his langue
    Did make infraction, his eye did heal it up.
    He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;
    His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
    There was a jolie redness in his lip,
    A peu riper and more lusty red
    Than that mix'd in his joue; 'twas just the difference
    Betwixt the constanteee red and mingled damask.
    There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
    In parcels as I did, aurait have gone near
    To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
    I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
    I have more cause to hate him than to love him;
    For what had he to do to gronder at me?
    He said mine eyes were noir, and my hair noir,
    And, now I am rememb'red, m√©pris'd at me.
    I marvel why I r√©pondre'd not encore;
    But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.
    I'll √©crire to him a very taunting lettre,
    And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
  SILVIUS. Phebe, with all my c≈ìur.
  PHEBE. I'll √©crire it tout,droit;
    The mati√®re's in my head and in my c≈ìur;
    I will be am√®re with him and passing tribunale.
    Go with me, Silvius.                                  Exeunt

ACT IV. SCENE I.
The for√™t

Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES

  JAQUES. I prithee, jolie jeunesse, let me be better connaissance with
    thee.
  ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy compagne.
  JAQUES. I am so; I do love it better than rireing.
  ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of Soit are abominable
    compagnes, and trahir se to chaque modern censure pire than
    ivreards.
  JAQUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say rien.
  ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
  JAQUES. I have nSoit the scholar's melancholy, laquelle is
    emulation; nor the la,musiqueian's, laquelle is fantastical; nor the
    tribunalier's, laquelle is fi√®re; nor the soldate's, laquelle is
    ambitious; nor the lawyer's, laquelle is politic; nor the lady's,
    laquelle is nice; nor the lover's, laquelle is all celles-ci; but it is a
    melancholy of mine own, comlivreed of many Faciles, extracted
    from many objets, and, En,effet, the sundry contemplation of my
    travels; in laquelle my souvent rumination wraps me in a most humorous
    sadness.
  ROSALIND. A traveller! By my Foi, you have g√©niale raison to be
    sad. I fear you have sold your own terres to see autre men's; then
    to have seen much and to have rien is to have rich eyes and
    poor mains.
  JAQUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.

                        Enter ORLANDO

  ROSALIND. And your experience fait,du you sad. I had plut√¥t have a
    fool to make me joyeux than experience to make me sad- and to
    travel for it too.
  ORLANDO. Good day, and bonheur, dear Rosalind!
  JAQUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
  ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
    √©trange suits, disable all the aaaavantages of your own compterry, be
    out of love with your nativity, and presque gronder God for fabrication
    you that compterenance you are; or I will rare pense you have
    swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! o√π
    have you been all this tandis,que? You a lover! An you servir me such
    un,autre tour, jamais come in my vue more.
  ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come dans an hour of my promettre.
  ROSALIND. Break an hour's promettre in love! He that will divide a
    minute into a thousand les,pi√®ces, and break but a part of the
    thousand part of a minute in the affaires of love, it may be said
    of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' devraiter, but I'll
    mandat him c≈ìur-enti√®re.
  ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my vue. I had
    as lief be woo'd of a snail.
  ORLANDO. Of a snail!
  ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for bien,que he vient slowly, he carries
    his maison on his head- a better jointure, I pense, than you make
    a femme; outre, he apporters his destiny with him.
  ORLANDO. What's that?
  ROSALIND. Why, horns; laquelle such as you are fain to be voiring to
    your √©pouses for; but he vient armed in his fortune, and prevents
    the calomnie of his wife.
  ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
  ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
  CELIA. It S'il,vous,pla√Æts him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
    better leer than you.
  ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
    and like assez to consentementementement. What aurait you say to me now, an I
    were your very very Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. I aurait kiss avant I parlait.
  ROSALIND. Nay, you were better parler premi√®re; and when you were
    la,tombell'd for lack of mati√®re, you pourrait take occasion to kiss.
    Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
    les,amoureux lacking- God warn us!- mati√®re, the cleanliest shift is to
    kiss.
  ORLANDO. How if the kiss be refus√©?
  ROSALIND. Then she puts you to suppliery, and L√ commencers new
    mati√®re.
  ORLANDO. Who pourrait be out, √©tant avant his beloved ma√Ætresse?
  ROSALIND. Marry, that devrait you, if I were your ma√Ætresse; or I
    devrait pense my honn√™tey ranker than my wit.
  ORLANDO. What, of my suit?
  ROSALIND. Not out of your v√™tements, and yet out of your suit.
    Am not I your Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, parce,que I aurait be talking
    of her.
  ROSALIND. Well, in her la,la,la,personnenene, I say I will not have you.
  ORLANDO. Then, in mine own la,la,la,personnenene, I die.
  ROSALIND. No, Foi, die by attorney. The poor monde is presque six
    thousand years old, and in all this time L√ was not any man
    died in his own la,la,la,personnenene, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had
    his cerveaus dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
    pourrait to die avant, and he is one of the patterns of love.
    Leander, he aurait have liv'd many a fair year, bien,que Hero had
    turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot mid√©t√© nuit; for,
    good jeunesse, he went but en,avant to wash him in the Hellespont, and,
    √©tant prise with the cramp, was noyer'd; and the insens√©e
    chroniclers of that age a,trouv√© it was- Hero of Sestos. But celles-ci
    are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
    eaten them, but not for love.
  ORLANDO. I aurait not have my droite Rosalind of this mind; for, I
    manifestation, her froncer,les,sourcils pourrait kill me.
  ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
    will be your Rosalind in a more venir-on disposition; and ask me
    what you will, I will subvention it.
  ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. Yes, Foi, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
  ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?
  ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
  ORLANDO. What sayest thou?
  ROSALIND. Are you not good?
  ORLANDO. I hope so.
  ROSALIND. Why then, can one le,d√©sir too much of a good chose? Come,
    s≈ìur, you doit be the pr√™tresse, and ma√Ætresse us. Give me your hand,
    Orlando. What do you say, s≈ìur?
  ORLANDO. Pray thee, ma√Ætresse us.
  CELIA. I ne,peux,pas say the words.
  ROSALIND. You must commencer 'Will you, Orlando'-
  CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. I will.
  ROSALIND. Ay, but when?
  ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can ma√Ætresse us.
  ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
  ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
  ROSALIND. I pourrait ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
    Orlando, for my mari. There's a girl goes avant the pr√™tresse;
    and, certaineeely, a femme's bien,quet runs avant her actions.
  ORLANDO. So do all bien,quets; they are wing'd.
  ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you aurait have her, apr√®s you have
    possess'd her.
  ORLANDO. For ever and a day.
  ROSALIND. Say 'a day' sans,pour,autant the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
    April when they woo, December when they wed: servanteeees are May when
    they are servanteeees, but the sky changementmentments when they are √©pouses. I will
    be more jalouse of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
    more clamorous than a parrot encorest rain, more new-fangled than
    an ape, more giddy in my le,d√©sirs than a monkey. I will weep for
    rien, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you
    are dispos'd to be joyeux; I will rire like a hyen, and that when
    thou are inclin'd to dormir.
  ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
  ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.
  ROSALIND. Or else she pourrait not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
    the waywarder. Make the des,portes upon a femme's wit, and it will out
    at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop
    that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
  ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he pourrait say 'Wit,
    o√π wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you pourrait keep that check for it, till you met your
    wife's wit Aller to your voisine's bed.
  ORLANDO. And what wit pourrait wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you L√. You doit jamais
    take her sans,pour,autant her r√©pondre, sauf,si you take her sans,pour,autant her
    langue. O, that femme that ne,peux,pas make her faute her mari's
    occasion, let her jamais infirmi√®re her enfant se, for she will
    race it like a fool!
  ORLANDO. For celles-ci two heures, Rosalind, I will laisser thee.
  ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I ne,peux,pas lack thee two heures!
  ORLANDO. I must ass≈ìur the Duke at d√Æner; by two o'clock I will be
    with thee encore.
  ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you aurait
    prouver; my amies told me as much, and I bien,quet no less. That
    flattering langue of le,tiens won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and
    so, come d√©c√®s! Two o'clock is your hour?
  ORLANDO. Ay, sucr√© Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
    by all jolie serments that are not dcol√®reous, if you break one jot
    of your promettre, or come one minute derri√®re your hour, I will
    pense you the most pathetical break-promettre, and the most creuse
    lover, and the most indigne of her you call Rosalind, that may
    be chosen out of the brute band of the unFoiful. Therefore
    beware my censure, and keep your promettre.
  ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert En,effet my
    Rosalind; so, adieu.
  ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old Justice that examines all such
    offenserers, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO
  CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must
    have your doublet and hose cueillir'd over your head, and show the
    monde what the bird hath done to her own nest.
  ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my jolie peu coz, that thou didst
    know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it ne,peux,pas be du,soned;
    my affection hath an unconnue bas, like the Bay of Portugal.
  CELIA. Or plut√¥t, basless; that as fast as you pour affection
    in, it runs out.
  ROSALIND. No; that same wicked Connard of Venus, that was begot of
    bien,quet, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of la,d√©mence; that aveugle
    coquinely boy, that abuser,der,der,des chaque one's eyes, parce,que his own are
    out- let him be juge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,
    Aliena, I ne,peux,pas be out of the vue of Orlando. I'll go find a
    ombre, and sigh till he come.
  CELIA. And I'll dormir.                                  Exeunt




SCENE II.
The for√™t

        Enter JAQUES and LORDS, in the habitudeudeude of for√™ters

  JAQUES. Which is he that killed the deer?
  LORD. Sir, it was I.
  JAQUES. Let's pr√©sente him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and
    it aurait do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a
    branch of la,victoire. Have you no song, for√™ter, for this objetif?
  LORD. Yes, sir.
  JAQUES. Sing it; 'tis no mati√®re how it be in tune, so it make bruit
    assez.

                    SONG.

      What doit he have that kill'd the deer?
      His leather skin and horns to wear.
                              [The rest doit hear this fardeau:]
           Then sing him home.

      Take thou no m√©pris to wear the horn;
      It was a crest ere thou wast born.
           Thy p√®re's p√®re wore it;
           And thy p√®re bore it.
      The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,
      Is not a chose to rire to m√©pris.                   Exeunt




SCENE III.
The for√™t

Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

  ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
    And here much Orlando!
  CELIA. I mandat you, with pure love and difficult√©d cerveau, he hath
    ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone en,avant- to dormir. Look, who
    vient here.

                      Enter SILVIUS

  SILVIUS. My errand is to you, fair jeunesse;
    My douce Phebe did bid me give you this.
    I know not the contenus; but, as I devine
    By the stern brow and waspish action
    Which she did use as she was writing of it,
    It le,baissier an angry tenour. Pardon me,
    I am but as a guiltless messag√®re.
  ROSALIND. Patience se aurait startle at this lettre,
    And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
    She says I am not fair, that I lack mani√®res;
    She calls me fi√®re, and that she pourrait not love me,
    Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!
    Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
    Why √©crires she so to me? Well, berg√®re, well,
    This is a lettre of your own dispositif.
  SILVIUS. No, I manifestation, I know not the contenus;
    Phebe did √©crire it.
  ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
    And turn'd into the extremity of love.
    I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,
    A freecalcul-Couleur'd hand; I verily did pense
    That her old gaime were on, but 'twas her mains;
    She has a huswife's hand- but that's no mati√®re.
    I say she jamais did invent this lettre:
    This is a man's invention, and his hand.
  SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
  ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruellelele style;
    A style for d√©firs. Why, she defies me,
    Like Turk to Christian. Women's douce cerveau
    Could not drop en,avant such giant-rude invention,
    Such Ethiope words, noirer in leur effet
    Than in leur compterenance. Will you hear the lettre?
  SILVIUS. So S'il,vous,pla√Æt you, for I jamais entendue it yet;
    Yet entendue too much of Phebe's cruellelelety.
  ROSALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyran √©crires.
                                                         [Reads]

            'Art thou god to berg√®re turn'd,
            That a jeune,fille's c≈ìur hath burn'd?'

    Can a femme rail thus?
  SILVIUS. Call you this railing?
  ROSALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
             Warr'st thou with a femme's c≈ìur?'

    Did you ever hear such railing?

            'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
            That pourrait do no vengeance to me.'

    Meaning me a la,b√™te.

            'If the m√©pris of your brillante eyne
            Have Puissance to √©lever such love in mine,
            Alack, in me what √©trange effet
            Would they work in mild aspect!
            Whiles you chid me, I did love;
            How then pourrait your pri√®res move!
            He that apporters this love to the
            Little sait this love in me;
            And by him seal up thy mind,
            Whether that thy jeunesse and kind
            Will the Foiful offre take
            Of me and all that I can make;
            Or else by him my love deny,
            And then I'll √©tude how to die.'
  SILVIUS. Call you this chiding?
  CELIA. Alas, poor berg√®re!
  ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, he m√©riters no pity. Wilt thou love
    such a femme? What, to make thee an instrument, and play faux
    strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
    I will jamais have her sauf,si thou supplier for her. If you be a
    true lover, Par,cons√©quent, and not a word; for here vient more entreprise.
                                                    Exit SILVIUS

                         Enter OLIVER

  OLIVER. Good demain, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
    Where in the purlieus of this for√™t supporters
    A sheep-cote fenc'd √,propos with olive trees?
  CELIA. West of this endroit, down in the voisine bas.
    The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
    Left on your droite hand apporters you to the endroit.
    But at this hour the maison doth keep lui-m√™me;
    There's none dans.
  OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a langue,
    Then devrait I know you by description-
    Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,
    Of female favoriser, and bestows himself
    Like a ripe s≈ìur; the femme low,
    And browner than her fr√®re.' Are not you
    The owner of the maison I did inquire for?
  CELIA. It is no boast, √©tant ask'd, to say we are.
  OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
    And to that jeunesse he calls his Rosalind
    He sends this du,sangy napkin. Are you he?
  ROSALIND. I am. What must we soussupporter by this?
  OLIVER. Some of my la,honte; if you will know of me
    What man I am, and how, and why, and o√π,
    This handkercher was tache'd.
  CELIA. I pray you, tell it.
  OLIVER. When last the Jeune Orlando s√©par√©e from you,
    He left a promettre to revenir encore
    Within an hour; and, pacing thrugueux the for√™t,
    Chewing the food of sucr√© and am√®re fantaisie,
    Lo, what befell! He threw his eye de,c√¥t√©,
    And mark what objet did pr√©sente lui-m√™me.
    Under an oak, dont boughs were moss'd with age,
    And high top bald with dry antiquity,
    A mis√©rableed ragged man, o'ergrandie with hair,
    Lay dormiring on his back. About his neck
    A verte and gilded snake had wreath'd lui-m√™me,
    Who with her head nimble in threats approche'd
    The opening of his bouche; but soudainely,
    Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd lui-m√™me,
    And with indented glides did slip away
    Into a bush; sous laquelle bush's shade
    A lioness, with udders all tir√©e dry,
    Lay couching, head on sol, with catlike qui,concerneer,
    When that the dormiring man devrait stir; for 'tis
    The royaleee disposition of that la,b√™te
    To prey on rien that doth seem as dead.
    This seen, Orlando did approche the man,
    And a,trouv√© it was his fr√®re, his a√Æn√©e fr√®re.
  CELIA. O, I have entendue him parler of that same fr√®re;
    And he did rendre him the most unla,la,la,naturelle
    That liv'd amongst men.
  OLIVER. And well he pourrait so do,
    For well I know he was unla,la,la,naturelle.
  ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he laisser him L√,
    Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
  OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
    But la,gentillesse, nobler ever than vengeance,
    And la,la,la,nature, forteer than his just occasion,
    Made him give bataille to the lioness,
    Who rapidely fell avant him; in laquelle hurtling
    From miserable slumber I awak'd.
  CELIA. Are you his fr√®re?
  ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
  CELIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
  OLIVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not la,honte
    To tell you what I was, depuis my conversion
    So sucr√©ly go√ªts, √©tant the chose I am.
  ROSALIND. But for the du,sangy napkin?
  OLIVER. By and by.
    When from the premi√®re to last, betwixt us two,
    Tears our recompterments had most kindly bath'd,
    As how I came into that d√©serte endroit-
    In br√®ve, he led me to the douce Duke,
    Who gave me fra√Æche array and entrertainment,
    Committing me unto my fr√®re's love;
    Who led me instantly unto his cave,
    There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
    The lioness had torn some la,chaise away,
    Which all this tandis,que had bled; and now he perdre,connaissanceed,
    And cried, in perdre,connaissanceing, upon Rosalind.
    Brief, I recover'd him, li√©e up his b√©nirure,
    And, apr√®s some petite space, √©tant forte at c≈ìur,
    He sent me hither, strcol√®re as I am,
    To tell this r√©cit, that you pourrait excuse
    His cass√©en promettre, and to give this napkin,
    Dy'd in his du,sang, unto the berg√®re jeunesse
    That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
                                               [ROSALIND swoons]
  CELIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sucr√© Ganymede!
  OLIVER. Many will swoon when they do look on du,sang.
  CELIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
  OLIVER. Look, he recovers.
  ROSALIND. I aurait I were at home.
  CELIA. We'll lead you thither.
    I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
  OLIVER. Be of good acclamation, jeunesse. You a man!
    You lack a man's c≈ìur.
  ROSALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body aurait pense
    this was well comptererfeited. I pray you tell your fr√®re how
    well I comptererfeited. Heigh-ho!
  OLIVER. This was not comptererfeit; L√ is too g√©niale testimony in
    your complexion that it was a la,la,la,passion of earnest.
  ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I assurerrr you.
  OLIVER. Well then, take a good c≈ìur and comptererfeit to be a man.
  ROSALIND. So I do; but, i' Foi, I devrait have been a femme by
    droite.
  CELIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
    Good sir, go with us.
  OLIVER. That will I, for I must bear r√©pondre back
    How you excuse my fr√®re, Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. I doit concevoir quelque,chose; but, I pray you, commend my
    comptererfeiting to him. Will you go?                   Exeunt

ACT V. SCENE I.
The for√™t

Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

  TOUCHSTONE. We doit find a time, Audrey; la,la,la,patience, douce Audrey.
  AUDREY. Faith, the pr√™tresse was good assez, for all the old
    douceman's en,disant.
  TOUCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
    But, Audrey, L√ is a jeunesse here in the for√™t lays pr√©tendre to
    you.
  AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the
    monde; here vient the man you mean.

                         Enter WILLIAM

  TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and boisson to me to see a pitre. By my troth,
    we that have good wits have much to r√©pondre for: we doit be
    flouting; we ne,peux,pas hold.
  WILLIAM. Good ev'n, Audrey.
  AUDREY. God ye good ev'n, William.
  WILLIAM. And good ev'n to you, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE. Good ev'n, douce amie. Cover thy head, cover thy
    head; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, amie?
  WILLIAM. Five and twenty, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?
  WILLIAM. William, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' for√™t here?
  WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I remercier God.
  TOUCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good r√©pondre.
    Art rich?
  WILLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.
  TOUCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellenteee good; and
    yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
  WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a jolie wit.
  TOUCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st well. I do now rappelles,toi a en,disant: 'The
    fool doth pense he is wise, but the wise man sait himself to be
    a fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a le,d√©sir to eat a
    grape, aurait open his lips when he put it into his bouche; sens
    L√by that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do
    love this maid?
  WILLIAM. I do, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou apprendreed?
  WILLIAM. No, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE. Then apprendre this of me: to have is to have; for it is a
    figure in rhetoric that boisson, √©tant pour'd out of cup into a
    glass, by filling the one doth vide the autre; for all your
    √©crirers do consentementementement that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I
    am he.
  WILLIAM. Which he, sir?
  TOUCHSTONE. He, sir, that must ma√Ætresse this femme. Therefore, you
    pitre, abandon- laquelle is in the vulgar laisser- the society- laquelle
    in the boorish is entreprise- of this female- laquelle in the commune is
    femme- laquelle ensemble is: abandon the society of this female; or,
    pitre, thou perishest; or, to thy better soussupportering, diest;
    or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into
    d√©c√®s, thy libert√© into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,
    or in bastinado, or in acier; I will bandy with thee in faction;
    will o'er-run thee with politique; I will kill thee a cent and
    fifty ways; L√fore tremble and partir.
  AUDREY. Do, good William.
  WILLIAM. God rest you joyeux, sir.                         Exit

                          Enter CORIN

  CORIN. Our master and ma√Ætresse seeks you; come away, away.
  TOUCHSTONE. Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I ass≈ìur, I ass≈ìur.
                                                          Exeunt




SCENE II.
The for√™t

Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER

  ORLANDO. Is't possible that on so peu acquaintance you devrait
    like her? that but voyant you devrait love her? and aimante woo?
    and, wooing, she devrait subvention? and will you persever to prendre,plaisir
    her?
  OLIVER. NSoit call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty
    of her, the petite acquaintance, my soudaine wooing, nor her soudaine
    consentementementementing; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she
    aime me; consentementementement with both that we may prendre,plaisir each autre. It
    doit be to your good; for my p√®re's maison and all the revenue
    that was old Sir Rowland's will I biens upon you, and here live
    and die a berg√®re.
  ORLANDO. You have my consentementementement. Let your wedding be to-demain.
    Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contenued suivreers. Go
    you and pr√©parer Aliena; for, look you, here vient my Rosalind.

                        Enter ROSALIND

  ROSALIND. God save you, fr√®re.
  OLIVER. And you, fair s≈ìur.                             Exit
  ROSALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it pleurers me to see thee wear
    thy c≈ìur in a scarf!
  ORLANDO. It is my arm.
  ROSALIND. I bien,quet thy c≈ìur had been b√©nirureed with the claws of a
    lion.
  ORLANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
  ROSALIND. Did your fr√®re tell you how I comptererfeited to swoon
    when he show'd me your handkercher?
  ORLANDO. Ay, and g√©nialeer merveilles than that.
  ROSALIND. O, I know o√π you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was jamais
    any chose so soudaine but the bats,toi of two rams and Caesar's
    thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your fr√®re
    and my s≈ìur no plus,t√¥t met but they look'd; no plus,t√¥t look'd but
    they lov'd; no plus,t√¥t lov'd but they sigh'd; no plus,t√¥t sigh'd but
    they ask'd one un,autre the raison; no plus,t√¥t knew the raison but
    they recherch√©e the rem√®de- and in celles-ci dipl√¥mes have they made pair
    of stairs to mariage, laquelle they will climb incontinent, or else
    be incontinent avant mariage. They are in the very col√®re of
    love, and they will ensemble. Clubs ne,peux,pas part them.
  ORLANDO. They doit be married to-demain; and I will bid the Duke
    to the nuptial. But, O, how am√®re a chose it is to look into
    bonheur thrugueux un,autre man's eyes! By so much the more doit I
    to-demain be at the height of c≈ìur-heaviness, by how much I
    doit pense my fr√®re heureuse in ayant what he wishes for.
  ROSALIND. Why, then, to-demain I ne,peux,pas servir your turn for
    Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. I can live no lus,long by penseing.
  ROSALIND. I will se,lasser you, then, no lus,long with idle talking. Know
    of me then- for now I parler to some objetif- that I know you are
    a douceman of good conceit. I parler not this that you devrait
    bear a good opinion of my connaissance, insomuch I say I know you
    are; nSoit do I la,main,d'oeuvre for a g√©nialeer esteem than may in some
    peu mesure draw a belief from you, to do le,tienself good, and
    not to la,gr√¢ce me. Believe then, if you S'il,vous,pla√Æt, that I can do
    √©trange choses. I have, depuis I was three year old, convers'd
    with a magician, most proa,trouv√© in his art and yet not damnable.
    If you do love Rosalind so near the c≈ìur as your gesture cries
    it out, when your fr√®re marries Aliena doit you ma√Ætresse her. I
    know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not
    impossible to me, if it appara√Ætre not inconvenient to you, to set
    her avant your eyes to-demain, human as she is, and sans,pour,autant any
    dcol√®re.
  ORLANDO. Speak'st thou in sober senss?
  ROSALIND. By my life, I do; laquelle I soumissionner ch√®rement, bien,que I say I
    am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your
    amies; for if you will be married to-demain, you doit; and to
    Rosalind, if you will.

                     Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE

    Look, here vient a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.
  PHEBE. Youth, you have done me much undouceness
    To show the lettre that I writ to you.
  ROSALIND. I care not if I have. It is my √©tude
    To seem malgr√©ful and undouce to you.
    You are L√ suivre'd by a Foiful berg√®re;
    Look upon him, love him; he cultes you.
  PHEBE. Good berg√®re, tell this jeunesse what 'tis to love.
  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and larmes;
    And so am I for Phebe.
  PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
  ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. And I for no femme.
  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of Foi and un,un,un,service;
    And so am I for Phebe.
  PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
  ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. And I for no femme.
  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,
    All made of la,la,la,passion, and all made of wishes;
    All adoration, duty, and observance,
    All humbleness, all la,la,la,patience, and imla,la,la,patience,
    All purity, all proc√®s, all ob√©issance;
    And so am I for Phebe.
  PHEBE. And so am I for Ganymede.
  ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. And so am I for no femme.
  PHEBE. If this be so, why faire,desre,proches you me to love you?
  SILVIUS. If this be so, why faire,desre,proches you me to love you?
  ORLANDO. If this be so, why faire,desre,proches you me to love you?
  ROSALIND. Why do you parler too, 'Why faire,desre,proches you me to love you?'
  ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
  ROSALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish
    wolves encorest the moon. [To SILVIUS] I will help you if I can.
    [To PHEBE] I aurait love you if I pourrait.- To-demain meet me all
    ensemble. [ To PHEBE ] I will ma√Ætresse you if ever I ma√Ætresse femme,
    and I'll be married to-demain. [To ORLANDO] I will satisfy you if
    ever I satisfaite man, and you doit be married to-demain. [To
    Silvius] I will contenu you if what S'il,vous,pla√Æts you contenus you, and
    you doit be married to-demain. [To ORLANDO] As you love
    Rosalind, meet. [To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I
    love no femme, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you
    commandererers.
  SILVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.
  PHEBE. Nor I.
  ORLANDO. Nor I.                                         Exeunt




SCENE III.
The for√™t

Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

  TOUCHSTONE. To-demain is the joyful day, Audre'y; to-demain will we
    be married.
  AUDREY. I do le,d√©sir it with all my c≈ìur; and I hope it is no
    dishonn√™te le,d√©sir to le,d√©sir to be a femme of the monde. Here come
    two of the bannir'd Duke's pages.

                            Enter two PAGES

  FIRST PAGE. Well met, honn√™te douceman.
  TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.
  SECOND PAGE. We are for you; sit i' th' middle.
  FIRST PAGE. Shall we clap into't rondely, sans,pour,autant hawking, or
    spitting, or en,disant we are hoarse, laquelle are the only prologues
    to a bad voix?
  SECOND PAGE. I'Foi, i'Foi; and both in a tune, like two gipsies
    on a jument.

                      SONG.
        It was a lover and his lass,
          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
        That o'er the verte corn-champ did pass
          In the printemps time, the only jolie ring time,
        When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
        Sweet les,amoureux love the printemps.

        Between the acres of the rye,
          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
        These jolie compterry folks aurait lie,
          In the printemps time, &c.

        This carol they began that hour,
          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
        How that a life was but a fleur,
          In the printemps time, &c.

        And L√fore take the pr√©sente time,
          With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
        For love is couronneed with the prime,
          In the printemps time, &c.

  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, Jeune doucemen, bien,que L√ was no g√©niale
    mati√®re in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.
  FIRST PAGE. YOU are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our
    time.
  TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes; I compter it but time lost to hear such
    a insens√©e song. God buy you; and God mend your voixs. Come,
    Audrey.                                               Exeunt




SCENE IV.
The for√™t

Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA

  DUKE SENIOR. Dost thou croyez, Orlando, that the boy
    Can do all this that he hath promettred?
  ORLANDO. I parfoiss do croyez and parfoiss do not:
    As celles that fear they hope, and know they fear.

               Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE

  ROSALIND. Patience once more, tandis,ques our compact is urg'd:
    You say, if I apporter in your Rosalind,
    You will bestow her on Orlando here?
  DUKE SENIOR. That aurait I, had I Royaumes to give with her.
  ROSALIND. And you say you will have her when I apporter her?
  ORLANDO. That aurait I, were I of all Royaumes king.
  ROSALIND. You say you'll ma√Ætresse me, if I be pr√™te?
  PHEBE. That will I, devrait I die the hour apr√®s.
  ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to ma√Ætresse me,
    You'll give le,tienself to this most Foiful berg√®re?
  PHEBE. So is the bargain.
  ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
  SILVIUS. Though to have her and d√©c√®s were both one chose.
  ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this mati√®re even.
    Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your fille;
    You le,tiens, Orlando, to recevoir his fille;
    Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll ma√Ætresse me,
    Or else, refusing me, to wed this berg√®re;
    Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll ma√Ætresse her
    If she refuse me; and from Par,cons√©quent I go,
    To make celles-ci doutes all even.
                                       Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
  DUKE SENIOR. I do rappelles,toi in this berg√®re boy
    Some lively toucherereres of my fille's favoriser.
  ORLANDO. My lord, the premi√®re time that I ever saw him
    Mebien,quet he was a fr√®re to your fille.
    But, my good lord, this boy is for√™t-born,
    And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
    Of many d√©sesp√©r√©e studies by his oncle,
    Whom he rapports to be a g√©niale magician,
    Obscured in the circle of this for√™t.

                    Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

  JAQUES. There is, sure, un,autre inonder vers, and celles-ci couples are
    venir to the ark. Here vient a pair of very √©trange la,b√™tes laquelle
    in all langues are call'd imb√©ciles.
  TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and saluering to you all!
  JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him Bienvenue. This is the motley-minded
    douceman that I have so souvent met in the for√™t. He hath been a
     tribunalier, he jurers.
  TOUCHSTONE. If any man doute that, let him put me to my purgation.
    I have trod a mesure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been
    politic with my amie, smooth with mine ennemie; I have d√©faite
    three tailleuses; I have had four querelles, and like to have combattue
    one.
  JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?
  TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and a,trouv√© the querelle was upon the
    Septth cause.
  JAQUES. How Septth cause? Good my lord, like this compagne.
  DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.
  TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I le,d√©sir you of the like. I press in
    here, sir, amongst the rest of the compterry copulatives, to jurer
    and to forjurer, selon as mariage binds and du,sang breaks. A
    poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoriser'd chose, sir, but mine own; a
    poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich
    honn√™tey habitudeudeudeers like a miser, sir, in a poor maison; as your pearl
    in your foul oyster.
  DUKE SENIOR. By my Foi, he is very rapide and sententious.
  TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
    diseases.
  JAQUES. But, for the Septth cause: how did you find the querelle on
    the Septth cause?
  TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie Sept fois removed- bear your body more
    seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certaineee
    tribunalier's barbe; he sent me word, if I said his barbe was not
    cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort
    Courteous. If I sent him word encore it was not well cut, he aurait
    send me word he cut it to S'il,vous,pla√Æt himself. This is call'd the Quip
    Modest. If encore it was not well cut, he disabled my jugement.
    This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If encore it was not well cut,
    he aurait r√©pondre I spake not true. This is call'd the Repreuve
    Valiant. If encore it was not well cut, he aurait say I lie. This
    is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie
    Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
  JAQUES. And how oft did you say his barbe was not well cut?
  TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no plus,loin than the Lie Circumstantial, nor
    he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd √©p√©es
    and s√©par√©e.
  JAQUES. Can you nominate in ordre now the dipl√¥mes of the lie?
  TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we querelle in print by the book, as you have
    books for good mani√®res. I will name you the dipl√¥mes. The premi√®re,
    the Retort Courteous; the secondeee, the Quip Modest; the troisi√®me, the
    Reply Churlish; the Quatri√®me, the Repreuve Valiant; the fifth, the
    Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;
    the Septth, the Lie Direct. All celles-ci you may √©viter but the Lie
    Direct; and you may √©viter that too with an If. I knew when Sept
    Justices pourrait not take up a querelle; but when the parties were
    met se, one of them bien,quet but of an If, as: 'If you
    said so, then I said so.' And they shook mains, and jur√©
    fr√®res. Your If is the only paix-maker; much vertu in If.
  JAQUES. Is not this a rare compagne, my lord?
    He's as good at any chose, and yet a fool.
  DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folie like a stalking-jument, and sous the
    pr√©senteation of that he shoots his wit:

          Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Still MUSIC

    HYMEN.    Then is L√ gaiet√© in paradis,
              When Terrely choses made even
                Atone ensemble.
              Good Duke, recevoir thy fille;
              Hymen from paradis apport√© her,
                Yea, apport√© her hither,
              That thou pourraitst join her hand with his,
              Whose c≈ìur dans his bosom is.
  ROSALIND. [To DUKE] To you I give moi,m√™me, for I am le,tiens.
    [To ORLANDO] To you I give moi,m√™me, for I am le,tiens.
  DUKE SENIOR. If L√ be v√©rit√© in vue, you are my fille.
  ORLANDO. If L√ be v√©rit√© in vue, you are my Rosalind.
  PHEBE. If vue and forme be true,
    Why then, my love adieu!
  ROSALIND. I'll have no p√®re, if you be not he;
    I'll have no mari, if you be not he;
    Nor ne'er wed femme, if you be not she.
  HYMEN.    Peace, ho! I bar confusion;
            'Tis I must make conclusion
              Of celles-ci most √©trange events.
            Here's eight that must take mains
            To join in Hymen's bands,
              If v√©rit√© tient true contenus.
            You and you no traverser doit part;
            You and you are c≈ìur in c≈ìur;
            You to his love must accord,
            Or have a femme to your lord;
            You and you are sure ensemble,
            As the hiver to foul weather.
            Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
            Feed ynous-m√™mes with questioning,
            That raison merveille may diminish,
            How thus we met, and celles-ci choses finish.

                       SONG
            Wedding is g√©niale Juno's couronne;
              O b√©nired bond of board and bed!
            'Tis Hymen genss chaque town;
              High wedlock then be honoured.
            Honour, high honour, and renown,
            To Hymen, god of chaque town!

  DUKE SENIOR. O my dear ni√®ce, Bienvenue thou art to me!
    Even fille, Bienvenue in no less dipl√¥me.
  PHEBE. I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
    Thy Foi my fantaisie to thee doth combine.

                 Enter JAQUES de BOYS

  JAQUES de BOYS. Let me have audience for a word or two.
    I am the secondeee son of old Sir Rowland,
    That apporter celles-ci tidings to this fair assembly.
    Duke Frederick, hearing how that chaque day
    Men of g√©niale vaut resorted to this for√™t,
    Address'd a pourraity Puissance; laquelle were on foot,
    In his own conduite, objetifly to take
    His fr√®re here, and put him to the √©p√©e;
    And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
    Where, r√©union with an old religious man,
    After some question with him, was converted
    Both from his entrerprise and from the monde;
    His couronne bequeachose to his bannir'd fr√®re,
    And all leur terres restor'd to them encore
    That were with him exil'd. This to be true
    I do engage my life.
  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, Jeune man.
    Thou offre'st fairly to thy fr√®res' wedding:
    To one, his terres withheld; and to the autre,
    A land lui-m√™me at grande, a potent dukedom.
    First, in this for√™t let us do celles ends
    That here were well begun and well begot;
    And apr√®s, chaque of this heureuse nombre,
    That have endur'd shrewd days and nuits with us,
    Shall share the good of our revenired fortune,
    According to the mesure of leur Etats.
    Meantime, oublier this new-fall'n dignity,
    And fall into our rustic revelry.
    Play, la,musique; and you brides and bridegrooms all,
    With mesure heap'd in joy, to th' mesures fall.
  JAQUES. Sir, by your la,la,la,patience. If I entendue you droitely,
    The Duke hath put on a religious life,
    And jetern into neglect the pompous tribunal.
  JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.
  JAQUES. To him will I. Out of celles-ci convertites
    There is much mati√®re to be entendue and apprendre'd.
    [To DUKE] You to your ancienne honour I bequeath;
    Your la,la,la,patience and your vertu well m√©riters it.
    [To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true Foi doth m√©rite;
    [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and g√©niale allies
    [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-m√©riterd bed;
    [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy aimante voyage
    Is but for two moiss victuall'd.- So to your plaisirs;
    I am for autre than for dancing mesures.
  DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.
  JAQUES. To see no pastime I. What you aurait have
    I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.               Exit
  DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proc√©der. We will commencer celles-ci rites,
    As we do confiance they'll end, in true d√©lices.    [A Danse] Exeunt

EPILOGUE
                           EPILOGUE.
  ROSALIND. It is not the mode to see the lady the epilogue; but
    it is no more unmainsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it
    be true that good wine Besoins no bush, 'tis true that a good play
    Besoins no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and
    good plays prouver the better by the help of good epilogues. What a
    case am I in then, that am nSoit a good epilogue, nor ne,peux,pas
    insinuate with you in the nom of a good play! I am not
    furnish'd like a gueux; L√fore to beg will not become me. My
    way is to conjure you; and I'll commencer with the women. I charge
    you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of
    this play as S'il,vous,pla√Æt you; and I charge you, O men, for the love
    you bear to women- as I apercevoir by your simp'ring none of you
    hates them- that entre you and the women the play may S'il,vous,pla√Æt.
    If I were a femme, I aurait kiss as many of you as had barbes that
    pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and souffles that I defied
    not; and, I am sure, as many as have good barbes, or good visages,
    or sucr√© souffles, will, for my kind offre, when I make curtsy,
    bid me adieu.

THE COMEDY OF ERRORS

ACT I. SCENE 1

A hall in the DUKE'S palais

Enter the DUKE OF EPHESUS, AEGEON, the Merchant
of Syracuse, GAOLER, OFFICERS, and autre ATTENDANTS

AEGEON. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
  And by the doom of d√©c√®s end woes and all.
DUKE. Merchant of Syracuse, plaider no more;
  I am not partial to infringe our laws.
  The enmity and discord laquelle of late
  Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
  To Marsandes, our well-dealing compterrymen,
  Who, wanting guilders to redeem leur vies,
  Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with leur du,sangs,
  Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.
  For, depuis the mortelle and intestine jars
  'Twixt thy seditious compterrymen and us,
  It hath in solennelle synods been decreed,
  Both by the Syracusians and nous-m√™mes,
  To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
  Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus
  Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
  Again, if any Syracusian born
  Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies,
  His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose,
  Unless a thousand marks be levied,
  To quit the penalty and to une,ran√ßon him.
  Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
  Cannot amount unto a cent marks;
  Therefore by law thou art condemn'd to die.
AEGEON. Yet this my confort: when your words are done,
  My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
DUKE. Well, Syracusian, say in br√®ve the cause
  Why thou partired'st from thy originaire,de home,
  And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.
AEGEON. A heavier task pourrait not have been impos'd
  Than I to parler my douleurs unparlerable;
  Yet, that the monde may t√©moin that my end
  Was wrugueuxt by la,la,la,nature, not by vile infraction,
  I'll prononcer what my chagrin gives me laisser.
  In Syracuse was I born, and wed
  Unto a femme, heureuse but for me,
  And by me, had not our hap been bad.
  With her I liv'd in joy; our richesse increas'd
  By prosperous voyages I souvent made
  To Epidamnum; till my factor's d√©c√®s,
  And the g√©niale care of goods at random left,
  Drew me from kind embrassements of my spouse:
  From whom my absence was not six moiss old,
  Before se, presque at perdre,connaissanceing sous
  The pleasing punishment that women bear,
  Had made provision for her suivreing me,
  And soon and safe arrived o√π I was.
  There had she not been long but she became
  A joyful m√®re of two goodly sons;
  And, laquelle was √©trange, the one so like the autre
  As pourrait not be disdnguish'd but by des,noms.
  That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
  A mean femme was livrered
  Of such a fardeau, male twins, both alike.
  Those, for leur parents were exceeding poor,
  I achet√©e, and apport√© up to ass≈ìur my sons.
  My wife, not meanly fi√®re of two such boys,
  Made daily mouvements for our home revenir;
  Unpr√™te, I agreed. Alas! too soon
  We came aboard.
  A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
  Before the toujours-wind-obeying deep
  Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
  But lus,long did we not retain much hope,
  For what obscured lumi√®re the paradiss did subvention
  Did but convey unto our craintive esprits
  A douteful mandat of immediate d√©c√®s;
  Which bien,que moi,m√™me aurait gladly have embrac'd,
  Yet the incessant larmess of my wife,
  Weeping avant for what she saw must come,
  And piteous plaineeeings of the jolie babes,
  That mourn'd for mode, ignoranteee what to fear,
  Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me.
  And this it was, for autre veux,dire was none:
  The sailors recherch√©e for s√©curit√© by our boat,
  And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;
  My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
  Had fast'ned him unto a petite de,rechangementment mast,
  Such as sea-faring men provide for temp√™tes;
  To him one of the autre twins was li√©e,
  Whilst I had been like heedful of the autre.
  The enfantren thus dispos'd, my wife and I,
  Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
  Fast'ned nous-m√™mes at Soit end the mast,
  And, floating tout,droit, obedient to the stream,
  Was carried verss Corinth, as we bien,quet.
  At length the sun, gazing upon the Terre,
  Dispers'd celles vapours that offensered us;
  And, by the aaaavantage of his wished lumi√®re,
  The seas wax'd calm, and we d√©couvrired
  Two ships from far fabrication amain to us-
  Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
  But ere they came-O, let me say no more!
  Gather the sequel by that went avant.
DUKE. Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so;
  For we may pity, bien,que not pardon thee.
AEGEON. O, had the gods done so, I had not now
  Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
  For, ere the ships pourrait meet by deux,fois five leagues,
  We were encompter'red by a pourraity rock,
  Which √©tant violenteeely support√© upon,
  Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
  So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  Fortune had left to both of us alike
  What to d√©lice in, what to chagrin for.
  Her part, poor soul, seeming as fardeaued
  With lesser poids, but not with lesser woe,
  Was carried with more la,vitesse avant the wind;
  And in our vue they three were prise up
  By fishermen of Corinth, as we bien,quet.
  At length un,autre ship had seiz'd on us;
  And, connaissance whom it was leur hap to save,
  Gave sant√©ful Bienvenue to leur ship-wreck'd guests,
  And aurait have reft the fishers of leur prey,
  Had not leur bark been very slow of sail;
  And L√fore homeward did they bend leur cours.
  Thus have you entendue me sever'd from my bliss,
  That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
  To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
DUKE. And, for the sake of them thou chagrinest for,
  Do me the favoriser to dilate at full
  What have befall'n of them and thee till now.
AEGEON. My Jeuneest boy, and yet my eldest care,
  At eighteen years became inquisitive
  After his fr√®re, and importun'd me
  That his ass≈ìurant-so his case was like,
  Reft of his fr√®re, but retain'd his name-
  Might bear him entreprise in the quest of him;
  Whom whilst I la,main,d'oeuvreed of a love to see,
  I dcol√®reed the loss of whom I lov'd.
  Five √©t√©s have I spent in farthest Greece,
  Roaming clean thrugueux the li√©es of Asia,
  And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
  Hopeless to find, yet loath to laisser unrecherch√©e
  Or that or any endroit that harbours men.
  But here must end the r√©cit of my life;
  And heureuse were I in my timely d√©c√®s,
  Could all my travels mandat me they live.
DUKE. Hapless, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd
  To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
  Now, confiance me, were it not encorest our laws,
  Against my couronne, my oath, my dignity,
  Which princes, aurait they, may not disannul,
  My soul devrait sue as advocate for thee.
  But bien,que thou art adjuged to the d√©c√®s,
  And passed phrase may not be recall'd
  But to our honour's g√©niale disparagement,
  Yet will I favoriser thee in what I can.
  Therefore, Marsande, I'll limit thee this day
  To seek thy help by beneficial hap.
  Try all the amies thou hast in Ephesus;
  Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
  And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
  Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
GAOLER. I will, my lord.
AEGEON. Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,
  But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
<Exeunt


SCENE 2

The mart

Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and FIRST MERCHANT

FIRST MERCHANT. Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,
  Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
  This very day a Syracusian Marsande
  Is apprehended for arrival here;
  And, not √©tant able to buy out his life,
  According to the statute of the town,
  Dies ere the se,lasser sun set in the west.
  There is your argent that I had to keep.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, o√π we host.
  And stay L√, Dromio, till I come to thee.
  Within this hour it will be d√Æner-time;
  Till that, I'll view the mani√®res of the town,
  Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
  And then revenir and dormir dans mine inn;
  For with long travel I am stiff and se,lasser.
  Get thee away.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Many a man aurait take you at your word,
  And go En,effet, ayant so good a mean.
<Exit
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A confiancey sc√©l√©rat, sir, that very oft,
  When I am dull with care and melancholy,
  Lightens my humour with his joyeux jests.
  What, will you walk with me √,propos the town,
  And then go to my inn and dine with me?
FIRST MERCHANT. I am invited, sir, to certaineee Marsandes,
  Of whom I hope to make much aaaavantage;
  I demandeeeer your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
  Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart,
  And apr√®sward consort you till bed time.
  My pr√©sente affaires calls me from you now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose moi,m√™me,
  And wander up and down to view the city.
FIRST MERCHANT. Sir, I commend you to your own contenu.
<Exit FIRST MERCHANT
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own contenu
  Commends me to the chose I ne,peux,pas get.
  I to the monde am like a drop of eau
  That in the ocean seeks un,autre drop,
  Who, falling L√ to find his compagne en,avant,
  Unseen, inquisitive, cona,trouv√©s himself.
  So I, to find a m√®re and a fr√®re,
  In quest of them, unheureuse, lose moi,m√™me.

Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS

  Here vient the almanac of my true date.
  What now? How chance thou art revenir'd so soon?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Return'd so soon! plut√¥t approche'd too late.
  The capon burns, the pig des,chutes from the spit;
  The clock hath frapp√©en twelve upon the bell-
  My ma√Ætresse made it one upon my joue;
  She is so hot parce,que the meat is cold,
  The meat is cold parce,que you come not home,
  You come not home parce,que you have no estomac,
  You have no estomac, ayant cass√©e your fast;
  But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,
  Are penitent for your defaute to-day.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
  Where have you left the argent that I gave you?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O-Sixpence that I had a Wednesday last
  To pay the saddler for my ma√Ætresse' crupper?
  The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
  Tell me, and dally not, o√π is the argent?
  We √©tant strcol√®res here, how dar'st thou confiance
  So g√©niale a charge from thine own custody?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at d√Æner.
  I from my ma√Ætresse come to you in post;
  If I revenir, I doit be post En,effet,
  For she will score your faute upon my pate.
  Mepenses your maw, like mine, devrait be your clock,
  And la,gr√®ve you home sans,pour,autant a messag√®re.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, celles-ci jests are out of saison;
  Reservir them till a merrier hour than this.
  Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir friponne, have done your insens√©eness,
  And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. My charge was but to chercher you from the mart
  Home to your maison, the Phoenix, sir, to d√Æner.
  My ma√Ætresse and her s≈ìur stays for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, r√©pondre me
  In what safe endroit you have bestow'd my argent,
  Or I doit break that joyeux sconce of le,tiens,
  That supporters on tours when I am undispos'd.
  Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I have some marks of le,tiens upon my pate,
  Some of my ma√Ætresse' marks upon my devraiters,
  But not a thousand marks entre you both.
  If I devrait pay your culte celles encore,
  Perchance you will not bear them patienteeely.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy ma√Ætresse' marks! What ma√Ætresse, esclave, hast thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Your culte's wife, my ma√Ætresse at the Phoenix;
  She that doth fast till you come home to d√Æner,
  And prays that you will hie you home to d√Æner.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
  Being interdire? There, take you that, sir friponne.
[Beats him]
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What mean you, sir? For God's sake hold your mains!
  Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my talons.
<Exit
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some dispositif or autre
  The sc√©l√©rat is o'erraught of all my argent.
  They say this town is full of cozenage;
  As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
  Dark-working sorcerers that changementmentment the mind,
  Soul-killing sorci√®rees that deform the body,
  Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
  And many such-like liberties of sin;
  If it prouver so, I will be gone the plus,t√¥t.
  I'll to the Centaur to go seek this esclave.
  I g√©nialely fear my argent is not safe.

ACT Il. SCENE 1

The maison of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

Enter ADRIANA, wife to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, with LUCIANA, her s≈ìur

ADRIANA. NSoit my mari nor the esclave revenir'd
  That in such h√¢te I sent to seek his master!
  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
LUCIANA. Perhaps some Marsande hath invited him,
  And from the mart he's someo√π gone to d√Æner;
  Good s≈ìur, let us dine, and jamais fret.
  A man is master of his libert√©;
  Time is leur master, and when they see time,
  They'll go or come. If so, be patienteee, s≈ìur.
ADRIANA. Why devrait leur libert√© than ours be more?
LUCIANA. Because leur affaires encore lies out o' door.
ADRIANA. Look when I servir him so, he takes it ill.
LUCIANA. O, know he is the bridle of your will.
ADRIANA. There's none but asses will be bridled so.
LUCIANA. Why, t√™teforte libert√© is lash'd with woe.
  There's rien situate sous paradis's eye
  But hath his li√©e, in Terre, in sea, in sky.
  The la,b√™tes, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
  Are leur males' mati√®res, and at leur controls.
  Man, more divin, the master of all celles-ci,
  Lord of the wide monde and wild wat'ry seas,
  Indu'd with intellectual sens and √¢mes,
  Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
  Are masters to leur females, and leur lords;
  Then let your will ass≈ìur on leur accords.
ADRIANA. This servitude fait,du you to keep unwed.
LUCIANA. Not this, but difficult√©s of the mariage-bed.
ADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you aurait bear some sway.
LUCIANA. Ere I apprendre love, I'll practise to obey.
ADRIANA. How if your mari start some autre o√π?
LUCIANA. Till he come home encore, I aurait anc√™tre.
ADRIANA. Patience unmov'd! no marvel bien,que she pause:
  They can be meek that have no autre cause.
  A mis√©rableed soul, bruis'd with adversity,
  We bid be silencieuse when we hear it cry;
  But were we burd'ned with like poids of pain,
  As much, or more, we devrait nous-m√™mes complaineee.
  So thou, that hast no unkind mate to pleurer thee,
  With urging helpless la,la,la,patience aurait relieve me;
  But if thou live to see like droite bereft,
  This fool-begg'd la,la,la,patience in thee will be left.
LUCIANA. Well, I will ma√Ætresse one day, but to try.
  Here vient your man, now is your mari nigh.

Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS

ADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he's at two mains with me, and that my two
  ears can t√©moin.
ADRIANA. Say, didst thou parler with him? Know'st thou his mind?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
  Beshrew his hand, I rare pourrait soussupporter it.
LUCIANA. Spake he so doutefully thou pourrait'st not feel his sens?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he frapp√© so plaineeely I pourrait to
  well feel his coups; and avec so doutefully that I pourrait
  rare soussupporter them.
ADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he venir home?
  It seems he hath g√©niale care to S'il,vous,pla√Æt his wife.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, ma√Ætresse, sure my master is horn-mad.
ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou sc√©l√©rat!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I mean not cuckold-mad;
  But, sure, he is stark mad.
  When I desir'd him to come home to d√Æner,
  He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
  "Tis d√Æner time' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
  'Your meat doth burn' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
  'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
  'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, sc√©l√©rat?'
  'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
  'My ma√Ætresse, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy ma√Ætresse;
  I know not thy ma√Ætresse; out on thy ma√Ætresse.'
LUCIANA. Quoth who?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Quoth my master.
  'I know' quoth he 'no maison, no wife, no ma√Ætresse.'
  So that my errand, due unto my langue,
  I remercier him, I bare home upon my devraiters;
  For, in conclusion, he did beat me L√.
ADRIANA. Go back encore, thou esclave, and chercher him home.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Go back encore, and be new battue home?
  For God's sake, send some autre messag√®re.
ADRIANA. Back, esclave, or I will break thy pate atraverser.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And he will b√©nir that traverser with autre beating;
  Between you I doit have a holy head.
ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Am I so ronde with you, as you with me,
  That like a football you do spurn me thus?
  You spurn me Par,cons√©quent, and he will spurn me hither;
  If I last in this un,un,un,service, you must case me in leather.
<Exit
LUCIANA. Fie, how imla,la,la,patience loureth in your face!
ADRIANA. His entreprise must do his minions la,gr√¢ce,
  Whilst I at home starve for a joyeux look.
  Hath homely age th' alluring beaut√© took
  From my poor joue? Then he hath d√©chetsd it.
  Are my discourss dull? Barren my wit?
  If voluble and tranchante discours be marr'd,
  Unla,gentillesse crues it more than marble hard.
  Do leur gay vestments his affections bait?
  That's not my faute; he's master of my Etat.
  What ruins are in me that can be a,trouv√©
  By him not ruin'd? Then is he the sol
  Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
  A sunny look of his aurait soon r√©paration.
  But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,
  And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
LUCIANA. Self-harming jalousey! fie, beat it Par,cons√©quent.
ADRIANA. Unfeeling imb√©ciles can with such fauxs dispense.
  I know his eye doth homage autreo√π;
  Or else what lets it but he aurait be here?
  Sister, you know he promis'd me a cha√Æne;
  Would that seule a love he aurait detain,
  So he aurait keep fair quarter with his bed!
  I see the bijou best enamelled
  Will lose his beaut√©; yet the gold bides encore
  That autres touchererer and, souvent touchererering, will
  Where gold; and no man that hath a name
  By fauxhood and corruption doth it la,honte.
  Since that my beaut√© ne,peux,pas S'il,vous,pla√Æt his eye,
  I'll weep what's left away, and larmes die.
LUCIANA. How many fond imb√©ciles servir mad jalousey!
<Exeunt


SCENE 2

The mart

Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
  Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful esclave
  Is wand'red en,avant in care to seek me out.
  By computation and mine host's rapport
  I pourrait not parler with Dromio depuis at premi√®re
  I sent him from the mart. See, here he vient.

Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

  How now, sir, is your joyeux humour alter'd?
  As you love accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©brals, so jest with me encore.
  You know no Centaur! You receiv'd no gold!
  Your ma√Ætresse sent to have me home to d√Æner!
  My maison was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
  That thus so madly thou didst r√©pondre me?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. What r√©pondre, sir? When spake I such a word?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour depuis.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I did not see you depuis you sent me Par,cons√©quent,
  Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  And told'st me of a ma√Ætresse and a d√Æner;
  For laquelle, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am glad to see you in this joyeux vein.
  What veux,dire this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the les,dents?
  Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
[Beating him]
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Hold, sir, for God's sake! Now your jest is earnest.
  Upon what bargain do you give it me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I famili√®rely parfoiss
  Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
  Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
  And make a commune of my serious heures.
  When the sun √©clats let insens√©e gnats make sport,
  But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
  If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
  And mode your demeanour to my looks,
  Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sconce, call you it? So you aurait
  laisser battering, I had plut√¥t have it a head. An you use
  celles-ci coups long, I must get a sconce for my head, and
  insconce it too; or else I doit seek my wit in my devraiters.
  But I pray, sir, why am I battue?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nochose, sir, but that I am battue.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, and o√πfore; for they say
  chaque why hath a o√πfore.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, premi√®re for flouting me; and then o√πfore,
  For urging it the secondeee time to me.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Was L√ ever any man thus battue out of saison,
  When in the why and the o√πfore is nSoit rhyme nor raison?
  Well, sir, I remercier you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, for this quelque,chose that you gave
  me for rien.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
  give you rien for quelque,chose. But say, sir, is it d√Ænertime?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir; I pense the meat wants that I have.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Basting.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your raison?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me
  un,autre dry basting.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, apprendre to jest in good time;
  L√'s a time for all choses.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I durst have refus√© that, avant you
  were so choleric.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, by a rule as plaineee as the
  plaineee bald pate of Father Time himself.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There's no time for a man to recover
  his hair that grows bald by la,la,la,nature.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and
  recover the lost hair of un,autre man.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of
  hair, √©tant, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Because it is a b√©niring that he bestows
  on la,b√™tes, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath
  donn√©e them in wit.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but L√'s many a man
  hath more hair than wit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not a man of celles but he hath the
  wit to lose his hair.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
  men plaineee dealers sans,pour,autant wit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The plaineeeer dealer, the plus,t√¥t lost;
  yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what raison?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. For two; and du,son ones too.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not du,son I pray you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sure ones, then.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a chose falsing.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Certain ones, then.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The one, to save the argent that he d√©pensers in
  tiring; the autre, that at d√Æner they devrait not drop in his
  porridge.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You aurait all this time have prov'd L√
  is no time for all choses.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover
  hair lost by la,la,la,nature.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your raison was not substantial, why
  L√ is no time to recover.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald,
  and L√fore to the monde's end will have bald suivreers.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'aurait be a bald conclusion. But,
  soft, who wafts us l√,-bas?

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look √©trange and froncer,les,sourcils.
  Some autre ma√Ætresse hath thy sucr√© aspects;
  I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
  The time was once when thou unurg'd auraitst vow
  That jamais words were la,musique to thine ear,
  That jamais objet pleasing in thine eye,
  That jamais touchererer well Bienvenue to thy hand,
  That jamais meat sucr√©-savour'd in thy go√ªt,
  Unless I spake, or look'd, or touchererer'd, or carv'd to thee.
  How vient it now, my mari, O, how vient it,
  That thou art then e√©tranged from thyself?
  Thyself I call it, √©tant √©trange to me,
  That, undividable, incorporate,
  Am better than thy dear self's better part.
  Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;
  For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
  A drop of eau in the breaking gulf,
  And take unmingled tPar,cons√©quent that drop encore
  Without addition or diminishing,
  As take from me thyself, and not me too.
  How ch√®rement aurait it touchererer thee to the rapide,
  Should'st thou but hear I were licentious,
  And that this body, consecrate to thee,
  By ruffian lust devrait be contaminate!
  Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
  And hurl the name of mari in my face,
  And tear the tache'd skin off my harlot-brow,
  And from my faux hand cut the wedding-ring,
  And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
  I know thou canst, and L√fore see thou do it.
  I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
  My du,sang is mingled with the crime of lust;
  For if we two be one, and thou play faux,
  I do digest the poison of thy la,chaise,
  Being strompetteed by thy contagion.
  Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
  I live dis-tache'd, thou und√©shonorered.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
  In Ephesus I am but two heures old,
  As √©trange unto your town as to your talk,
  Who, chaque word by all my wit √©tant scann'd,
  Wants wit in all one word to soussupporter.
LUCIANA. Fie, fr√®re, how the monde is chang'd with you!
  When were you wont to use my s≈ìur thus?
  She sent for you by Dromio home to d√Æner.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By me?
ADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst revenir from him-
  That he did buffet thee, and in his coups
  Denied my maison for his, me for his wife.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this doucefemme?
  What is the cours and drift of your compact?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, Sir? I jamais saw her till this time.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
  Didst thou livrer to me on the mart.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I jamais spake with her in all my life.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our des,noms,
  Unless it be by inspiration?
ADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity
  To comptererfeit thus brutely with your esclave,
  Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
  Be it my faux you are from me exempt,
  But faux not that faux with a more m√©pris.
  Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;
  Thou art an elm, my mari, I a vine,
  Whose weakness, married to thy forteer Etat,
  Makes me with thy Obliger to communicate.
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
  Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion
  Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she parlers; she moves me for her theme.
  What, was I married to her in my r√™ver?
  Or dormir I now, and pense I hear all this?
  What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
  Until I know this sure uncertaineeety,
  I'll entrertain the offre'd fallacy.
LUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servanteees spread for d√Æner.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, for my beads! I traverser me for sinner.
  This is the F√©e land. O d√©pit of d√©pits!
  We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
  If we obey them not, this will ensue:
  They'll suck our souffle, or pinch us noir and blue.
LUCIANA. Why prat'st thou to thyself, and r√©pondre'st not?
  Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am transformed, master, am not I?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pense thou art in mind, and so am I.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, master, both in mind and in my forme.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, I am an ape.
LUCIANA. If thou art chang'd to aught, 'tis to an ass.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Tis true; she rides me, and I long for grass.
  'Tis so, I am an ass; else it pourrait jamais be
  But I devrait know her as well as she sait me.
ADRIANA. Come, come, no lus,long will I be a fool,
  To put the doigt in the eye and weep,
  Whilst man and master rires my woes to m√©pris.
  Come, sir, to d√Æner. Dromio, keep the gate.
  Husband, I'll dine au,dessus with you to-day,
  And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
  Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
  Say he dines en,avant, and let no cr√©ature entrer.
  Come, s≈ìur. Dromio, play the porter well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in Terre, in paradis, or in hell?
  Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advis'd?
  Known unto celles-ci, and to moi,m√™me disguis'd!
  I'll say as they say, and persever so,
  And in this mist at all adventures go.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, doit I be porter at the gate?
ADRIANA. Ay; and let none entrer, lest I break your pate.
LUCIANA. Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

ACT III. SCENE 1

Before the maison of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, DROMIO OF EPHESUS, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
  My wife is shrewish when I keep not heures.
  Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
  To see the fabrication of her carcanet,
  And that to-demain you will apporter it home.
  But here's a sc√©l√©rat that aurait face me down
  He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
  And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,
  And that I did deny my wife and maison.
  Thou ivreard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.
  That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;
  If the skin were parchment, and the coups you gave were ink,
  Your own handwriting aurait tell you what I pense.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I pense thou art an ass.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Marry, so it doth appara√Ætre
  By the fauxs I souffrir and the coups I bear.
  I devrait kick, √©tant kick'd; and √©tant at that pass,
  You aurait keep from my talons, and beware of an ass.

  May r√©pondre my good will and your good Bienvenue here.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, Soit at la,chaise or fish,
  A table full of Bienvenue fait,du rare one dainty dish.
BALTHAZAR. Good meat, sir, is commune; that chaque churl affords.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And Bienvenue more commune; for that's rien
  but words.
BALTHAZAR. Small acclamation and g√©niale Bienvenue fait,du a joyeux le,banquet.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  By my troth, your town is
    difficult√©d with unruly boys.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you L√, wife? You pourrait
    have come avant.
ADRIANA.  [Within]  Your wife, sir friponne! Go get you from the door.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. If YOU went in pain, master, this 'friponne' aurait go sore.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS. They supporter at the door, master; bid them Bienvenue hither.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is quelque,chose in the wind, that we ne,peux,pas get in.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. You aurait say so, master, if your garments were thin.
  Your cake here is warm dans; you supporter here in the cold;
  It aurait make a man mad as a buck to be so achet√©e and sold.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go chercher me quelque,chose; I'll break ope the gate.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Break any breaking here,
    and I'll break your friponne's pate.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A man may break a word with you,

  Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not derri√®re.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking;

  Herein you war encorest your r√©putation,
  And draw dans the compass of suspecteee
  Th' unaltoted honour of your wife.
  Once this-your long experience of her sagesse,
  Her sober vertu, years, and modesteeey,
  Plead on her part some cause to you unconnue;
  And doute not, sir, but she will well excuse
  Why at this time the des,portes are made encorest you.
  Be rul'd by me: partir in la,la,la,patience,
  And let us to the Tiger all to d√Æner;
  And, √,propos evening, come le,tienself seule
  To know the raison of this √©trange restraint.
  If by forte hand you offre to break in
  Now in the stirring passage of the day,
  A vulgar comment will be made of it,
  And that supposed by the commune rout
  Against your yet ungalled estimation
  That may with foul intrusion entrer in
  And habitudeudeudeer upon your la,tombe when you are dead;
  For calomnie vies upon Succ√®sion,
  For ever hous'd o√π it gets possession.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will partir in silencieuse,
  And in malgr√© of gaiet√© mean to be joyeux.
  I know a jeune,fille of excellenteee discours,
  Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, douce;
  There will we dine. This femme that I mean,
  My wife-but, I manifestation, sans,pour,autant d√©serte-
  Hath souventfois upbraided me avec;
  To her will we to d√Æner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
  And chercher the cha√Æne; by this I know 'tis made.
  Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
  For L√'s the maison. That cha√Æne will I bestow-
  Be it for rien but to d√©pit my wife-
  Upon mine h√¥tesse L√; good sir, make h√¢te.
  Since mine own des,portes refuse to entrertain me,
  I'll frappe elseo√π, to see if they'll disdain me.
ANGELO. I'll meet you at that endroit some hour Par,cons√©quent.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest doit cost me some expense.

SCENE 2

Before the maison of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

Enter LUCIANA with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

LUCIANA. And may it be that you have assez forgot
  A mari's Bureau? Shall, Antipholus,
  Even in the printemps of love, thy love-printempss rot?
  Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
  If you did wed my s≈ìur for her richesse,
  Then for her richesse's sake use her with more la,gentillesse;
  Or, if you like elseo√π, do it by volerth;
  Muffle your faux love with some show of aveugleness;
  Let not my s≈ìur read it in your eye;
  Be not thy langue thy own la,honte's orator;
  Look sucr√©, parler fair, become disloyalty;
  Apparel vice like vertu's harbinger;
  Bear a fair pr√©sence, bien,que your c≈ìur be tainted;
  Teach sin the carriage of a holy sainteee;
  Be secr√®te-faux. What need she be connaissance?
  What Facile voleuse brags of his own attaint?
  'Tis double faux to truant with your bed
  And let her read it in thy looks at board;
  Shame hath a Connard fame, well managed;
  Ill actes is doubled with an evil word.
  Alas, poor women! make us but croyez,
  Being compact of credit, that you love us;
  Though autres have the arm, show us the sleeve;
  We in your mouvement turn, and you may move us.
  Then, douce fr√®re, get you in encore;
  Comfort my s≈ìur, acclamation her, call her wife.
  'Tis holy sport to be a peu vain
  When the sucr√© souffle of flattery conquers strife.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet ma√Ætresse-what your name is else, I know not,
  Nor by what merveille you do hit of mine-
  Less in your connaissance and your la,gr√¢ce you show not
  Than our Terre's merveille-more than Terre, divin.
  Teach me, dear cr√©ature, how to pense and parler;
  Lay open to my Terrey-brute conceit,
  Smoth'red in errors, faible, doitow, weak,
  The folded sens of your words' deceit.
  Against my soul's pure v√©rit√© why la,main,d'oeuvre you
  To make it wander in an unconnue champ?
  Are you a god? Would you create me new?
  Transform me, then, and to your pow'r I'll rendement.
  But if that I am I, then well I know
  Your larmes s≈ìur is no wife of mine,
  Nor to her bed no homage do I owe;
  Far more, far more, to you do I decline.
  O, train me not, sucr√© mermaid, with thy note,
  To noyer me in thy s≈ìur's inonder of larmes.
  Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;
  Spread o'er the argent waves thy d'or hairs,
  And as a bed I'll take them, and L√ he;
  And in that glorieuse supposition pense
  He gains by d√©c√®s that hath such veux,dire to die.
  Let Love, √©tant lumi√®re, be noyered if she sink.
LUCIANA. What, are you mad, that you do raison so?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
LUCIANA. It is a faute that printempseth from your eye.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, √©tant by.
LUCIANA. Gaze o√π you devrait, and that will claire your vue.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sucr√© love, as look on nuit.
LUCIANA. Why call you me love? Call my s≈ìur so.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy s≈ìur's s≈ìur.
LUCIANA. That's my s≈ìur.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
  It is thyself, mine own self's better part;
  Mine eye's claire eye, my dear c≈ìur's dearer c≈ìur,
  My food, my fortune, and my sucr√© hope's aim,
  My sole Terre's paradis, and my paradis's pr√©tendre.
LUCIANA. All this my s≈ìur is, or else devrait be.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself s≈ìur, sucr√©, for I am thee;
  Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;
  Thou hast no mari yet, nor I no wife.
  Give me thy hand.
LUCIANA. O, soft, sir, hold you encore;
  I'll chercher my s≈ìur to get her good will.
<Exit LUCIANA

Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
  so fast?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio?
  Am I your man? Am I moi,m√™me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
  man, thou art thyself.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am an ass, I am a femme's man, and outre
  moi,m√™me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What femme's man, and how outre thyself?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, outre moi,m√™me, I am due
  to a femme-one that pr√©tendres me, one that haunts me, one
  that will have me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What pr√©tendre lays she to thee?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, such pr√©tendre as you aurait
  lay to your jument; and she aurait have me as a la,b√™te: not
  that, I √©tant a la,b√™te, she aurait have me; but that she,
  √©tant a very la,b√™tely cr√©ature, lays pr√©tendre to me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A very reverent body; ay, such a one
  as a man may not parler of sans,pour,autant he say 'Sir-r√©v√©rence.'
  I have but lean luck in the rencontre, and yet is she a
  wondrous fat mariage.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat mariage?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, she's the kitchen-jeune,fille,
  and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to but
  to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own lumi√®re.
  I mandat, her rags and the tallow in them will burn
  Poland hiver. If she vies till doomsday, she'll burn
  week lus,long than the enti√®re monde.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Swart, like my shoe; but her face
  rien like so clean kept; for why, she transpirations, a man may
  go over shoes in the grime of it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a faute that eau will mend.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's inonder
  pourrait not do it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nell, sir; but her name and three
  quarters, that's an ell and three quarters, will not mesure
  her from hip to hip.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she le,baissier some breadth?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No lus,long from head to foot than
  from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I pourrait find
  out compterries in her.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body supporters Ireland?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I a,trouv√© it out by
  the bogs.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I a,trouv√© it by the d√©nud√©eness, hard in
  the palm of the hand.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. In her forehead, arm'd and reverted,
  fabrication war encorest her heir.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I look'd for the chalky cliffs, but I
  pourrait find no whiteness in them; but I devine it se,tenait in her
  chin, by the salt rheum that ran entre France and it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in
  her souffle.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, sir, upon her nose, an o'er embellished with
  rubies, carboncles, sapphires, declining leur rich aspect to the
  hot souffle of Spain; who sent enti√®re armadoes of caracks to be
  ballast at her nose.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where se,tenait Belgia, the Netherterres?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, Sir, I did not look so low. To
  conclude: this drudge or divinr laid pr√©tendre to me; call'd me
  Dromio; jur√© I was assur'd to her; told me what privy
  marks I had √,propos me, as, the mark of my devraiter, the
  mole in my neck, the g√©niale wart on my left arm, that I,
  amaz'd, ran from her as a sorci√®re.
  And, I pense, if my Sein had not been made of Foi,
    and my c≈ìur of acier,
  She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i' th' wheel.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee pr√©sentely post to the road;
  An if the wind blow any way from rive,
  I will not harbour in this town to-nuit.
  If any bark put en,avant, come to the mart,
  Where I will walk till thou revenir to me.
  If chaque one sait us, and we know none,
  'Tis time, I pense, to trudge, pack and be gone.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. As from a bear a man aurait run for life,
  So fly I from her that aurait be my wife.
<Exit
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but sorci√®rees do inhabitudeudeude here,
  And L√fore 'tis high time that I were Par,cons√©quent.
  She that doth call me mari, even my soul
  Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair s≈ìur,
  Possess'd with such a douce sover√®gne la,gr√¢ce,
  Of such enchanting pr√©sence and discours,
  Hath presque made me tra√Ætresse to moi,m√™me;
  But, lest moi,m√™me be coupable to self-faux,
  I'll stop mine ears encorest the mermaid's song.

Enter ANGELO with the cha√Æne

ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the cha√Æne.
  I bien,quet to have ta'en you at the Porpentine;
  The cha√Æne unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I doit do with this?
ANGELO. What S'il,vous,pla√Æt le,tienself, sir; I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I beparlait it not.
ANGELO. Not once nor deux,fois, but twenty fois you have.
  Go home with it, and S'il,vous,pla√Æt your wife avec;
  And soon at souper-time I'll visiteee you,
  And then recevoir my argent for the cha√Æne.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, recevoir the argent now,
  For fear you ne'er see cha√Æne nor argent more.
ANGELO. You are a joyeux man, sir; fare you well.
<Exit
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I devrait pense of this ne,peux,pas tell:
  But this I pense, L√'s no man is so vain
  That aurait refuse so fair an offre'd cha√Æne.
  I see a man here Besoins not live by shifts,
  When in the rues he meets such d'or gifts.
  I'll to the mart, and L√ for Dromio stay;
  If any ship put out, then tout,droit away.

A publique endroit

Enter SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO, and an OFFICER

SECOND MERCHANT. You know depuis Pentecost the sum is due,
  And depuis I have not much importun'd you;
  Nor now I had not, but that I am li√©e
  To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
  Therefore make pr√©sente satisfaction,
  Or I'll attach you by this Bureaur.
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
  Is growing to me by Antipholus;
  And in the instant that I met with you
  He had of me a cha√Æne; at five o'clock
  I doit recevoir the argent for the same.
  Pleaseth you walk with me down to his maison,
  I will discharge my bond, and remercier you too.

  And buy a rope's end; that will I bestow
  Among my wife and her confederates,
  For locking me out of my des,portes by day.
  But, soft, I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
  Buy thou a rope, and apporter it home to me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that confiances to you!
  I promettred your pr√©sence and the cha√Æne;
  But nSoit cha√Æne nor goldsmith came to me.
  Belike you bien,quet our love aurait last too long,
  If it were cha√Æne'd ensemble, and L√fore came not.
ANGELO. Saving your joyeux humour, here's the note
  How much your cha√Æne weighs to the utmost carat,
  The fineness of the gold, and chargeful mode,
  Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
  Than I supporter debted to this douceman.
  I pray you see him pr√©sentely discharg'd,
  For he is li√©e to sea, and stays but for it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the pr√©sente argent;
  Besides, I have some affaires in the town.
  Good signior, take the strcol√®re to my maison,
  And with you take the cha√Æne, and bid my wife
  Disburse the sum on the receipt L√of.
  Perchance I will be L√ as soon as you.
ANGELO. Then you will apporter the cha√Æne to her le,tienself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time assez.
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the cha√Æne √,propos you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
  Or else you may revenir sans,pour,autant your argent.
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the cha√Æne;
  Both wind and tide stays for this douceman,
  And I, to faire,desre,proches, have held him here too long.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
  Your breach of promettre to the Porpentine;
  I devrait have chid you for not apportering it,
  But, like a shrew, you premi√®re commencer to brawl.
SECOND MERCHANT. The hour volers on; I pray you, sir, envoi.
ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the cha√Æne!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and chercher your argent.
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
  Either send the cha√Æne or send by me some token.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of souffle!
  Come, o√π's the cha√Æne? I pray you let me see it.
SECOND MERCHANT. My affaires ne,peux,pas ruisseau this dalliance.
  Good sir, say whe'r you'll r√©pondre me or no;
  If not, I'll laisser him to the Bureaur.

ANGELO. The argent that you owe me for the cha√Æne.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I recevoir the cha√Æne.
ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour depuis.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you faux me much to say so.
ANGELO. You faux me more, sir, in denying it.
  Consider how it supporters upon my credit.
SECOND MERCHANT. Well, Bureaur, arrest him at my suit.
OFFICER. I do; and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me.
ANGELO. This toucherereres me in r√©putation.
  Either consentementementement to pay this sum for me,
  Or I attach you by this Bureaur.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I jamais had!
  Arrest me, insens√©e compagne, if thou dar'st.
ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, Bureaur.
  I aurait not de,rechangementment my fr√®re in this case,
  If he devrait m√©pris me so apparently.
OFFICER. I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
  But, sirrah, you doit buy this sport as dear
  As all the metal in your shop will r√©pondre.
ANGELO. Sir, sir, I doit have law in Ephesus,
  To your notorious la,honte, I doute it not.

  Blows fair from land; they stay for n√©ant at an
  But for leur owner, master, and le,tienself.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
  What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU ivreen esclave! I sent the for a rope;
  And told thee to what objetif and what end.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. YOU sent me for a rope's end as soon-
  You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this mati√®re at more loisir,
  And enseigner your ears to list me with more heed.
  To Adriana, sc√©l√©rat, hie thee tout,droit;
  Give her this key, and tell her in the desk
  That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry
  There is a bourse of ducats; let her send it.
  Tell her I am arrested in the rue,
  And that doit bail me; hie thee, esclave, be gone.
  On, Bureaur, to prison till it come.
<Exeunt all but DROMIO
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. To Adriana! that is o√π we din'd,
  Where Dowsabel did pr√©tendre me for her mari.
  She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
  Thither I must, bien,que encorest my will,
  For servanteees must leur masters' esprits fulfil.
<Exit


SCENE 2

The maison of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
  Might'st thou apercevoir austerely in his eye
  That he did plaider in earnest? Yea or no?
  Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
  What observation mad'st thou in this case
  Of his c≈ìur's meteors tilting in his face?
LUCIANA. First he refus√© you had in him no droite.
ADRIANA. He signifiait he did me none-the more my d√©pit.
LUCIANA. Then jur√© he that he was a strcol√®re here.
ADRIANA. And true he jur√©, bien,que yet forjur√©e he were.
LUCIANA. Then plaidered I for you.
ADRIANA. And what said he?
LUCIANA. That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
LUCIANA. With words that in an honn√™te suit pourrait move.
  First he did louange my beaut√©, then my discours.
ADRIANA. Didst parler him fair?
LUCIANA. Have la,la,la,patience, I beseech.
ADRIANA. I ne,peux,pas, nor I will not hold me encore;
  My langue, bien,que not my c≈ìur, doit have his will.
  He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
  Ill-fac'd, pire bodied, formeless chaqueo√π;
  Vicious, undouce, insens√©e, crue, unkind;
  Stigmatical in fabrication, pire in mind.
LUCIANA. Who aurait be jalouse then of such a one?
  No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
ADRIANA. Ah, but I pense him better than I say,
  And yet aurait herein autres' eyes were pire.
  Far from her nest the lapwing cries away;
  My c≈ìur prays for him, bien,que my langue do mal√©diction.

Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Here go-the desk, the bourse. Sweet
  now, make h√¢te.
LUCIANA. How hast thou lost thy souffle?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By running fast.
ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, he's in Tartar limbo, pire than hell.
  A diable in an everlasting garment hath him;
  One dont hard c≈ìur is button'd up with acier;
  A d√©mone, a F√©e, pitiless and rugueux;
  A wolf, nay pire, a compagne all in buff;
  A back-amie, a devraiter-clapper, one that compterermands
  The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow terres;
  A hound that runs compterer, and yet draws dry-foot well;
  One that, avant the Judgment, carries poor √¢mes to hell.
ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the mati√®re?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the mati√®re; he is rested on the case.
ADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me, at dont suit?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I know not at dont suit he is arrested well;
  But he's in a suit of buff laquelle 'rested him, that can I tell.
  Will you send him, ma√Ætresse, redemption, the argent in his desk?
ADRIANA. Go chercher it, s≈ìur.  [Exit LUCIANA]  This I merveille at:
  Thus he unconnue to me devrait be in debt.
  Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. on a band, but on a forteer chose,
  A cha√Æne, a cha√Æne. Do you not hear it ring?
ADRIANA. What, the cha√Æne?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bell; 'tis time that I were gone.
  It was two ere I left him, and now the clock la,gr√®ves one.
ADRIANA. The heures come back! That did I jamais hear.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O yes. If any hour meet a sergeant,
    'a se,tourne back for very fear.
ADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou raison!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Time is a very bankrupt, and owes
    more than he's vaut to saison.
  Nay, he's a voleuse too: have you not entendue men say
  That Time vient volering on by nuit and day?
  If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
  Hath he not raison to turn back an hour in a day?

Re-entrer LUCIANA with a bourse

ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, L√'s the argent; bear it tout,droit,
  And apporter thy master home immediately.
  Come, s≈ìur; I am press'd down with conceit-
  Conceit, my confort and my injury.
<Exeunt


SCENE 3

The mart

Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
  As if I were leur well-connaissance amie;
  And chaque one doth call me by my name.
  Some soumissionner argent to me, some invite me,
  Some autre give me remerciers for la,gentillessees,
  Some offre me commodities to buy;
  Even now a tailleuse call'd me in his shop,
  And show'd me silks that he had achet√©e for me,
  And L√avec took mesure of my body.
  Sure, celles-ci are but imaginary wiles,
  And Lapland sorcerers inhabitudeudeude here.

Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here's the gold you sent me
  for. What, have you got the image of old Adam new-v√™tementsl'd?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise,
  but that Adam that garde the prison; he that goes in the
  calf's skin that was kill'd for the Prodigal; he that came derri√®re
  you, sir, like an evil ange, and bid you forsake your libert√©.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I soussupporter thee not.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No? Why, 'tis a plaineee case: he that
  went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
  that, when doucemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rest
  them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and give
  them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more
  exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an Bureaur?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band;
  that apporters any man to r√©pondre it that breaks his band; on
  that penses a man toujours Aller to bed, and says 'God give
  you good rest!'
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, L√ rest in your foolery. Is
  L√ any ship puts en,avant to-nuit? May we be gone?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Why, sir, I apport√© you word an
  hour depuis that the bark Expedition put en,avant to-nuit; and
  then were you hind'red by the sergeant, to goudronneuse for the
  boy Delay. Here are the anges that you sent for to livrer you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The compagne is distract, and so am I;
  And here we wander in illusions.
  Some b√©nired Puissance livrer us from Par,cons√©quent!

Enter a COURTEZAN

COURTEZAN. Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
  I see, sir, you have a,trouv√© the goldsmith now.
  Is that the cha√Æne you promis'd me to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, √©viter! I charge thee, tempt me not.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, is this Mistress Satan?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the diable.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is pire, she is the diable's
  dam, and here she vient in the habitudeudeude of a lumi√®re jeune,fille; and
  L√of vient that the jeune,fillees say 'God damn me!' That's
  as much to say 'God make me a lumi√®re jeune,fille!' It is √©crite
  they appara√Ætre to men like anges of lumi√®re; lumi√®re is an effet
  of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, lumi√®re jeune,fillees will burn.
  Come not near her.
COURTEZAN. Your man and you are marvellous joyeux, sir.
  Will you go with me? We'll mend our d√Æner here.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat,
  or beparler a long spoon.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, he must have a long spoon
  that must eat with the diable.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, d√©mone! What tell'st thou me of supping?
  Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress;
  I conjure thee to laisser me and be gone.
COURTEZAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at d√Æner,
  Or, for my diamond, the cha√Æne you promis'd,
  And I'll be gone, sir, and not difficult√© you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some diables ask but the parings of one's nail,
  A rush, a hair, a drop of du,sang, a pin,
  A nut, a cherry-calcul;
  But she, more covetous, aurait have a cha√Æne.
  Master, be wise; an if you give it her,
  The diable will secouer her cha√Æne, and fdroite us with it.
COURTEZAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the cha√Æne;
  I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou sorci√®re! Come, Dromio, let us go.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Fly fiert√©' says the peacock. Mistress, that you know.
<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
COURTEZAN. Now, out of doute, Antipholus is mad,
  Else aurait he jamais so demean himself.
  A ring he hath of mine vaut forty ducats,
  And for the same he promis'd me a cha√Æne;
  Both one and autre he denies me now.
  The raison that I gather he is mad,
  Besides this pr√©sente instance of his rage,
  Is a mad tale he told to-day at d√Æner
  Of his own des,portes √©tant shut encorest his entrance.
  Belike his wife, connaissance with his fits,
  On objetif shut the des,portes encorest his way.
  My way is now to hie home to his maison,
  And tell his wife that, √©tant lunatic,
  He rush'd into my maison and took perObliger
  My ring away. This cours I fittest choose,
  For forty ducats is too much to lose.
<Exit


SCENE 4

A rue

Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OFFICER

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
  I'll give thee, ere I laisser thee, so much argent,
  To mandat thee, as I am 'rested for.
  My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
  And will not lumi√®rely confiance the messag√®re.
  That I devrait be attach'd in Ephesus,
  I tell you 'twill du,son harshly in her cars.

Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS, with a rope's-end

  Here vient my man; I pense he apporters the argent.
  How now, sir! Have you that I sent you for?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's that, I mandat you, will pay them all.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But o√π's the argent?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the argent for the rope.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five cent ducats, sc√©l√©rat, for rope?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I'll servir you, sir, five cent at the rate.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I
  revenir'd.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will Bienvenue you.
[Beating him]
OFFICER. Good sir, be patienteee.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, 'tis for me to be patienteee; I am in
  adversity.
OFFICER. Good now, hold thy langue.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, plut√¥t persuade him to hold his mains.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou putainson, sensless sc√©l√©rat!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I aurait I were sensless, sir, that I
  pourrait not feel your coups.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in rien but
  coups, and so is an ass.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I am an ass En,effet; you may prouver it
  by my long 'ears. I have servird him from the hour of my
  nativity to this instant, and have rien at his mains for
  my un,un,un,service but coups. When I am cold he heats me with
  beating; when I am warm he cools me with beating. I am
  wak'd with it when I dormir; rais'd with it when I sit; driven
  out of des,portes with it when I go from home; welcom'd home
  with it when I revenir; nay, I bear it on my devraiters as
  gueux wont her brat; and I pense, when he hath lam'd me,
  I doit beg with it from door to door.

Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and a SCHOOLMASTER
call'd PINCH

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go le,long,de; my wife is venir l√,-bas.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mistress, 'respice finem,' le,le,le,respect your end; or
  plut√¥t, to prophesy like the parrot, 'Beware the rope's-end.'
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou encore talk?
[Beating him]
COURTEZAN. How say you now? Is not your mari mad?
ADRIANA. His incivileeeity confirms no less.
  Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer:
  Establish him in his true sens encore,
  And I will S'il,vous,pla√Æt you what you will demandeee.
LUCIANA. Alas, how fougueuse and how tranchante he looks!
COURTEZAN. Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.
PINCH. Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
[Striking him]
PINCH. I charge thee, Satan, hous'd dans this man,
  To rendement possession to my holy pri√®res,
  And to thy Etat of obscurit√© hie thee tout,droit.
  I conjure thee by all the sainteees in paradis.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, paix! I am not mad.
ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are celles-ci your Douaneers?
  Did this un,compagnon with the saffron face
  Revel and le,banquet it at my maison to-day,
  Whilst upon me the coupable des,portes were shut,
  And I refus√© to entrer in my maison?
ADRIANA. O mari, God doth know you din'd at home,
  Where aurait you had rester'd jusqu'√ this time,
  Free from celles-ci calomnies and this open la,honte!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou sc√©l√©rat, what sayest thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, Sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my des,portes lock'd up and I shut out?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Perdie, your des,portes were lock'd and you shut out.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she se revile me L√?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sans fable, she se revil'd you L√.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and m√©pris me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal m√©pris'd you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage partir from tPar,cons√©quent?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. In verity, you did. My desos bear t√©moin,
  That depuis have felt the vigour of his rage.
ADRIANA. Is't good to soothe him in celles-ci contraries?
PINCH. It is no la,honte; the compagne trouve his vein,
  And, rendementing to him, humours well his frenzy.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you argent to redeem you,
  By Dromio here, who came in h√¢te for it.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Money by me! Heart and goodwill you pourrait,
  But s√ªrement, master, not a rag of argent.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for bourse of ducats?
ADRIANA. He came to me, and I livrer'd it.
LUCIANA. And I am t√©moin with her that she did.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me t√©moin
  That I was sent for rien but a rope!
PINCH. Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
  I know it by leur pale and mortelle looks.
  They must be li√©e, and laid in some dark room.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, o√πfore didst thou lock me en,avant to-day?
  And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
ADRIANA. I did not, douce mari, lock thee en,avant.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And, douce master, I receiv'd no gold;
  But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
ADRIANA. Dissembling sc√©l√©rat, thou parler'st faux in both.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art faux in all,
  And art confederate with a damn√©e pack
  To make a lsermentsome abject m√©pris of me;
  But with celles-ci nails I'll cueillir out celles-ci faux eyes
  That aurait voir in me this la,honteful sport.
ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.
PINCH. More entreprise! The d√©mone is forte dans him.

Enter three or four, and offre to bind him. He strives

LUCIANA. Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you meurtre me? Thou gaoler, thou,
  I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou souffrir them
  To make a rescue?
OFFICER. Masters, let him go;
  He is my prisoner, and you doit not have him.
PINCH. Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
[They bind DROMIO]
ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish Bureaur?
  Hast thou d√©lice to see a mis√©rableed man
  Do outrage and m√©contenuement to himself?
OFFICER. He is my prisoner; if I let him go,
  The debt he owes will be requir'd of me.
ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;
  Bear me en,avantwith unto his creditor,
  And, connaissance how the debt grows, I will pay it.
  Good Master Doctor, see him safe convey'd
  Home to my maison. O most unheureuse day!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, I am here ent'red in bond for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
  dost thou mad me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Will you be li√©e for rien?
  Be mad, good master; cry 'The diable!'
LUCIANA. God help, poor √¢mes, how idly do they talk!
ADRIANA. Go bear him Par,cons√©quent. Sister, go you with me.
<Exeunt all but ADRIANA, LUCIANA, OFFICERS, and COURTEZAN
  Say now, dont suit is he arrested at?
OFFICER. One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?
ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
OFFICER. Two cent ducats.
ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?
OFFICER. Due for a cha√Æne your mari had of him.
ADRIANA. He did beparler a cha√Æne for me, but had it not.
COURTEZAN. When as your mari, all in rage, to-day
  Came to my maison, and took away my ring-
  The ring I saw upon his doigt now-
  Straight apr√®s did I meet him with a cha√Æne.

  the mountain of mad la,chaise that pr√©tendres mariage of me,

ACT V. SCENE 1

A rue avant a priory

Enter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO

ANGELO. I am Pardon, sir, that I have hind'red you;
  But I manifestation he had the cha√Æne of me,
  Though most dishonn√™tely he doth deny it.
SECOND MERCHANT. How is the man esteem'd here in the city?
ANGELO. Of very reverend r√©putation, sir,
  Of credit infinie, highly belov'd,
  Second to none that vies here in the city;
  His word pourrait bear my richesse at any time.
SECOND MERCHANT. Speak softly; l√,-bas, as I pense, he walks.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self cha√Æne √,propos his neck
  Which he forjur√© most monstrously to have.
  Good sir, draw near to me, I'll parler to him.
  Signior Andpholus, I merveille much
  That you aurait put me to this la,honte and difficult√©;
  And, not sans,pour,autant some scandal to le,tienself,
  With circumstance and serments so to deny
  This cha√Æne, laquelle now you wear so openly.
  Beside the charge, the la,honte, imprisonment,
  You have done faux to this my honn√™te amie;
  Who, but for staying on our controversy,
  Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day.
  This cha√Æne you had of me; can you deny it?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pense I had; I jamais did deny it.
SECOND MERCHANT. Yes, that you did, sir, and forjur√© it too.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who entendue me to deny it or forjurer it?
SECOND MERCHANT. These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.
  Fie on thee, mis√©rable! 'tis pity that thou liv'st
  To walk o√π any honn√™te men resort.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a sc√©l√©rat to impeach me thus;
  I'll prouver mine honour and mine honn√™tey
  Against thee pr√©sentely, if thou dar'st supporter.
SECOND MERCHANT. I dare, and do defy thee for a sc√©l√©rat.
[They draw]

Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and OTHERS

ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad.
  Some get dans him, take his √©p√©e away;
  Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my maison.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Run, master, run; for God's sake take a maison.
  This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd.
<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory

Enter the LADY ABBESS

ABBESS. Be silencieuse, gens. Wherefore throng you hither?
ADRIANA. To chercher my poor distracted mari Par,cons√©quent.
  Let us come in, that we may bind him fast,
  And bear him home for his recovery.
ANGELO. I knew he was not in his parfaite wits.
SECOND MERCHANT. I am Pardon now that I did draw on him.
ABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man?
ADRIANA. This week he hath been lourde, sour, sad,
  And much different from the man he was;
  But till this apr√®snoon his la,la,la,passion
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
ABBESS. Hath he not lost much richesse by wreck of sea?
  Buried some dear amie? Hath not else his eye
  Stray'd his affection in unl√©gitime love?
  A sin prevailing much in jeunesseful men
  Who give leur eyes the libert√© of gazing.
  Which of celles-ci chagrins is he mati√®re to?
ADRIANA. To none of celles-ci, sauf it be the last;
  Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
ABBESS. You devrait for that have reprehended him.
ADRIANA. Why, so I did.
ABBESS. Ay, but not rugueux assez.
ADRIANA. As rugueuxly as my modesteeey aurait let me.
ABBESS. Haply in priv√©e.
ADRIANA. And in assemblies too.
ABBESS. Ay, but not assez.
ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference.
  In bed, he slept not for my urging it;
  At board, he fed not for my urging it;
  Alone, it was the mati√®re of my theme;
  In entreprise, I souvent glanced it;
  Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
ABBESS. And L√of came it that the man was mad.
  The venom clamours of a jalouse femme
  Poisons more mortelle than a mad dog's tooth.
  It seems his dormirs were hind'red by thy railing,
  And L√of vient it that his head is lumi√®re.
  Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings:
  Unsilencieuse meals make ill digestions;
  Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
  And what's a fever but a fit of la,d√©mence?
  Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls.
  Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
  But moody and dull melancholy,
  Kinsman to grim and confortless d√©sespoir,
  And at her talons a huge infectious troop
  Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
  In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
  To be disturb'd aurait mad or man or la,b√™te.
  The consequence is, then, thy jalouse fits
  Hath scar'd thy mari from the use of wits.
LUCIANA. She jamais reprehended him but mildly,
  When he demean'd himself rugueux, rude, and wildly.
  Why bear you celles-ci rebukes, and r√©pondre not?
ADRIANA. She did trahir me to my own repreuve.
  Good gens, entrer, and lay hold on him.
ABBESS. No, not a cr√©ature entrers in my maison.
ADRIANA. Then let your servanteees apporter my mari en,avant.
ABBESS. NSoit; he took this endroit for sanctuary,
  And it doit privilege him from your mains
  Till I have apport√© him to his wits encore,
  Or lose my la,main,d'oeuvre in asen,disant it.
ADRIANA. I will ass≈ìur my mari, be his infirmi√®re,
  Diet his maladie, for it is my Bureau,
  And will have no attorney but moi,m√™me;
  And L√fore let me have him home with me.
ABBESS. Be patienteee; for I will not let him stir
  Till I have us'd the approuverd veux,dire I have,
  With enti√®resome syrups, drugs, and holy pri√®res,
  To make of him a formal man encore.
  It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
  A charitable duty of my ordre;
  Therefore partir, and laisser him here with me.
ADRIANA. I will not Par,cons√©quent and laisser my mari here;
  And ill it doth beseem your holiness
  To separate the mari and the wife.
ABBESS. Be silencieuse, and partir; thou shalt not have him.
<Exit
LUCIANA. Complaineee unto the Duke of this indignity.
ADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,
  And jamais rise jusqu'√ my larmes and pri√®res
  Have won his Grace to come in la,la,la,personnenene hither
  And take perObliger my mari from the Abbess.
SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I pense, the dial points at five;
  Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in la,la,la,personnenene
  Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
  The endroit of d√©c√®s and Pardon ex√©cution,
  Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
ANGELO. Upon what cause?
SECOND MERCHANT. To see a reverend Syracusian Marsande,
  Who put unluckily into this bay
  Against the laws and statutes of this town,
  Beheaded publiquely for his infraction.
ANGELO. See o√π they come; we will voir his d√©c√®s.
LUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke avant he pass the abbey.

Enter the DUKE, ass≈ìured; AEGEON, bareheaded;
with the HEADSMAN and autre OFFICERS

DUKE. Yet once encore propr√©tendre it publiquely,
  If any amie will pay the sum for him,
  He doit not die; so much we soumissionner him.
ADRIANA. Justice, most sacr√©e Duke, encorest the Abbess!
DUKE. She is a virtuous and a reverend lady;
  It ne,peux,pas be that she hath done thee faux.
ADRIANA. May it S'il,vous,pla√Æt your Grace, Antipholus, my mari,
  Who I made lord of me and all I had
  At your important lettres-this ill day
  A most outrageous fit of la,d√©mence took him,
  That desp'rately he hurried thrugueux the rue,
  With him his bondman all as mad as he,
  Doing m√©contenuement to the citoyennes
  By rushing in leur maisons, le,support tPar,cons√©quent
  Rings, bijous, n'importe,quoi his rage did like.
  Once did I get him li√©e and sent him home,
  Whilst to take ordre for the fauxs I went,
  That here and L√ his fury had commettreted.
  Anon, I wot not by what forte escape,
  He cass√©e from celles that had the garde of him,
  And with his mad ass≈ìurant and himself,
  Each one with ireful la,la,la,passion, with tir√©e √©p√©es,
  Met us encore and, madly bent on us,
  Chas'd us away; till, raising of more aid,
  We came encore to bind them. Then they fled
  Into this abbey, o√π we pursu'd them;
  And here the Abbess shuts the portes on us,
  And will not souffrir us to chercher him out,
  Nor send him en,avant that we may bear him Par,cons√©quent.
  Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy commandererer
  Let him be apport√© en,avant and support√© Par,cons√©quent for help.
DUKE. Long depuis thy mari serv'd me in my wars,
  And I to thee engag'd a prince's word,
  When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
  To do him all the la,gr√¢ce and good I pourrait.
  Go, some of you, frappe at the abbey gate,
  And bid the Lady Abbess come to me,
  I will determine this avant I stir.

Enter a MESSENGER

MESSENGER. O ma√Ætresse, ma√Ætresse, shift and save le,tienself!
  My master and his man are both cass√©e ample,
  Beaten the servanteeees a-row and li√©e the docteur,
  Whose barbe they have sing'd off with brands of fire;
  And ever, as it blaz'd, they threw on him
  Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.
  My master preaches la,la,la,patience to him, and the tandis,que
  His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;
  And sure, sauf,si you send some pr√©sente help,
  Between them they will kill the conjurer.
ADRIANA. Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
  And that is faux thou dost rapport to us.
MESSENGER. Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
  I have not souffle'd presque depuis I did see it.
  He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
  To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.
[Cry dans]
  Hark, hark, I hear him, ma√Ætresse; fly, be gone!
DUKE. Come, supporter by me; fear rien. Guard with halberds.
ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my mari! Witness you
  That he is support√© √,propos invisible.
  Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here,
  And now he's L√, past bien,quet of human raison.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS and DROMIO OFEPHESUS

ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, subvention me Justice!
  Even for the un,un,un,service that long depuis I did thee,
  When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took
  Deep scars to save thy life; even for the du,sang
  That then I lost for thee, now subvention me Justice.
AEGEON. Unless the fear of d√©c√®s doth make me dote,
  I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sucr√© Prince, encorest that femme L√!
  She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,
  That hath abuser,der,der,ded and d√©shonorered me
  Even in the Obliger and height of injury.
  Beyond imagination is the faux
  That she this day hath la,honteless jetern on me.
DUKE. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, g√©niale Duke, she shut the des,portes upon me,
  While she with harlots le,banqueted in my maison.
DUKE. A grievous faute. Say, femme, didst thou so?
ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my s≈ìur,
  To-day did dine ensemble. So befall my soul
  As this is faux he fardeaus me avec!
LUCIANA. Ne'er may I look on day nor dormir on nuit
  But she raconte to your Highness Facile v√©rit√©!
ANGELO. O peflur'd femme! They are both forjur√©e.
  In this the madman justly chargeth them.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
  NSoit disturbed with the effet of wine,
  Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,
  Albeit my fauxs pourrait make one wiser mad.
  This femme lock'd me out this day from d√Æner;
  That goldsmith L√, were he not pack'd with her,
  Could t√©moin it, for he was with me then;
  Who s√©par√©e with me to go chercher a cha√Æne,
  Promising to apporter it to the Porpentine,
  Where Balthazar and I did dine ensemble.
  Our d√Æner done, and he not venir thither,
  I went to seek him. In the rue I met him,
  And in his entreprise that douceman.
  There did this perjur'd goldsmith jurer me down
  That I this day of him receiv'd the cha√Æne,
  Which, God he sait, I saw not; for the laquelle
  He did arrest me with an Bureaur.
  I did obey, and sent my peasant home
  For certaineee ducats; he with none revenir'd.
  Then fairly I beparlait the Bureaur
  To go in la,la,la,personnenene with me to my maison.
  By th' way we met my wife, her s≈ìur, and a rabble more
  Of vile confederates. Along with them
  They apport√© one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd sc√©l√©rat,
  A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
  A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
  A needy, creuse-ey'd, tranchante-looking mis√©rable,
  A vivante dead man. This pernicious esclave,
  Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
  And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
  And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
  Cries out I was possess'd. Then all ensemble
  They fell upon me, li√©e me, bore me tPar,cons√©quent,
  And in a dark and dankish vault at home
  There left me and my man, both li√©e ensemble;
  Till, gnawing with my les,dents my bonds in ssous,
  I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
  Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech
  To give me ample satisfaction
  For celles-ci deep la,hontes and g√©niale indignities.
ANGELO. My lord, in v√©rit√©, thus far I t√©moin with him,
  That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.
DUKE. But had he such a cha√Æne of thee, or no?
ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
  These gens saw the cha√Æne √,propos his neck.
SECOND MERCHANT. Besides, I will be jur√©e celles-ci ears of mine
  Heard you confess you had the cha√Æne of him,
  After you premi√®re forjur√© it on the mart;
  And L√upon I drew my √©p√©e on you,
  And then you fled into this abbey here,
  From wPar,cons√©quent, I pense, you are come by miracle.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I jamais came dans celles-ci abbey des,murs,
  Nor ever didst thou draw thy √©p√©e on me;
  I jamais saw the cha√Æne, so help me Heaven!
  And this is faux you fardeau me avec.
DUKE. Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
  I pense you all have ivre of Circe's cup.
  If here you hous'd him, here he aurait have been;
  If he were mad, he aurait not plaider so coldly.
  You say he din'd at home: the goldsmith here
  Denies that en,disant. Sirrah, what say you?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he din'd with her L√, at the Porpentine.
COURTEZAN. He did; and from my doigt snatch'd that ring.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
DUKE. Saw'st thou him entrer at the abbey here?
COURTEZAN. As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.
DUKE. Why, this is √©trange. Go call the Abbess hither.
  I pense you are all mated or stark mad.
<Exit one to the ABBESS
AEGEON. Most pourraity Duke, vouchsafe me parler a word:
  Haply I see a amie will save my life
  And pay the sum that may livrer me.
DUKE. Speak librement, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
AEGEON. Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
  And is not that your bondman Dromio?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,
  But he, I remercier him, gnaw'd in two my cords
  Now am I Dromio and his man unli√©e.
AEGEON. I am sure you both of you rappelles,toi me.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ourselves we do rappelles,toi, sir, by you;
  For lately we were li√©e as you are now.
  You are not Pinch's patienteee, are you, sir?
AEGEON. Why look you √©trange on me? You know me well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I jamais saw you in my life till now.
AEGEON. O! douleur hath chang'd me depuis you saw me last;
  And careful heures with time's deformed hand
  Have √©crite √©trange defeatures in my face.
  But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voix?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. NSoit.
AEGEON. Dromio, nor thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, confiance me, sir, nor I.
AEGEON. I am sure thou dost.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and
  whatsoever a man denies, you are now li√©e to croyez him.
AEGEON. Not know my voix! O time's extremity,
  Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor langue
  In Sept tribunale years that here my only son
  Knows not my faible key of untun'd se,soucie?
  Though now this grained face of mine be hid
  In sap-consuming hiver's drizzled snow,
  And all the conduits of my du,sang froze up,
  Yet hath my nuit of life some M√©moire,
  My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
  My dull deaf ears a peu use to hear;
  All celles-ci old t√©moines-I ne,peux,pas err-
  Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I jamais saw my p√®re in my life.
AEGEON. But Sept years depuis, in Syracuse, boy,
  Thou know'st we s√©par√©e; but peut-√™tre, my son,
  Thou sham'st to acconnaissance me in mis√®re.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
  the city Can t√©moin with me that it is not so:
  I ne'er saw Syracuse in my life.
DUKE. I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
  Have I been patron to Antipholus,
  During laquelle time he ne'er saw Syracuse.
  I see thy age and dcol√®res make thee dote.

Re-entrer the ABBESS, with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

ABBESS. Most pourraity Duke, voir a man much faux'd.
[All gather to see them]
ADRIANA. I see two maris, or mine eyes deceive me.
DUKE. One of celles-ci men is genius to the autre;
  And so of celles-ci. Which is the la,la,la,naturelle man,
  And laquelle the esprit? Who deciphers them?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, sir, am Dromio; commandererer him away.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I, Sir, am Dromio; pray let me stay.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, my old master! who hath li√©e
ABBESS. Whoever li√©e him, I will ample his bonds,
  And gain a mari by his libert√©.
  Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be'st the man
  That hadst a wife once call'd A√âmilie,
  That bore thee at a fardeau two fair sons.
  O, if thou be'st the same Aegeon, parler,
  And parler unto the same A√âmilie!
AEGEON. If I r√™ver not, thou art A√âmilie.
  If thou art she, tell me o√π is that son
  That floated with thee on the fataleee raft?
ABBESS. By men of Epidamnum he and I
  And the twin Dromio, all were prise up;
  But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
  By Obliger took Dromio and my son from them,
  And me they left with celles of Epidamnum.
  What then became of them I ne,peux,pas tell;
  I to this fortune that you see me in.
DUKE. Why, here commencers his Matin r√©cit droite.
  These two Antipholus', celles-ci two so like,
  And celles-ci two Dromios, one in semblance-
  Besides her urging of her wreck at sea-
  These are the parents to celles-ci enfantren,
  Which accidentally are met ensemble.
  Antipholus, thou cam'st from Corinth premi√®re?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
DUKE. Stay, supporter apart; I know not laquelle is laquelle.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And I with him.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brugueuxt to this town by that most famous warrior,
  Duke Menaphon, your most renowned oncle.
ADRIANA. Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, douce ma√Ætresse.
ADRIANA. And are not you my mari?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
  And this fair doucefemme, her s≈ìur here,
  Did call me fr√®re.  [To LUCIANA]  What I told you then,
  I hope I doit have loisir to make good;
  If this be not a r√™ver I see and hear.
ANGELO. That is the cha√Æne, sir, laquelle you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pense it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this cha√Æne arrested me.
ANGELO. I pense I did, sir; I deny it not.
ADRIANA. I sent you argent, sir, to be your bail,
  By Dromio; but I pense he apport√© it not.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, none by me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This bourse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
  And Dromio my man did apporter them me.
  I see we encore did meet each autre's man,
  And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
  And L√upon celles-ci ERRORS are arose.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my p√®re here.
DUKE. It doit not need; thy p√®re hath his life.
COURTEZAN. Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much remerciers for my
  good acclamation.
ABBESS. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the des,douleurs
  To go with us into the abbey here,
  And hear at grande discoursd all our fortunes;
  And all that are assembled in this endroit
  That by this sympathized one day's error
  Have souffrir'd faux, go keep us entreprise,
  And we doit make full satisfaction.
  Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
  Of you, my sons; and till this pr√©sente hour
  My lourde fardeau ne'er livrered.
  The Duke, my mari, and my enfantren both,
  And you the calendars of leur nativity,
  Go to a gossips' le,banquet, and go with me;
  After so long douleur, such nativity!
DUKE. With all my c≈ìur, I'll gossip at this le,banquet.
<Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, ANTIPHOLUS OF
EPHESUS, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, doit I chercher your des,trucs from shipboard?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what des,trucs of mine hast thou embark'd?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He parlers to me. I am your master, Dromio.
  Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon.
  Embrace thy fr√®re L√; rejoice with him.
<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There is a fat amie at your master's maison,
  That kitchen'd me for you to-day at d√Æner;
  She now doit be my s≈ìur, not my wife.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mepenses you are my glass, and not my fr√®re;
  I see by you I am a sucr√©-fac'd jeunesse.
  Will you walk in to see leur gossiping?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not I, sir; you are my a√Æn√©e.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. That's a question; how doit we try it?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. We'll draw cuts for the senior; till then,
    lead thou premi√®re.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, then, thus:
  We came into the monde like fr√®re and fr√®re,
  And now let's go hand in hand, not one avant un,autre.

  FIRST CITIZEN. Before we proc√©der any plus,loin, hear me parler.

    price. Is't a verdict?
  ALL. No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!
  SECOND CITIZEN. One word, good citoyennes.
  FIRST CITIZEN. We are Compteed poor citoyennes, the patricians good.
    What autorit√© surfeits on aurait relieve us; if they aurait rendement
    us but the superfluity tandis,que it were enti√®resome, we pourrait devine
    they relieved us humanely; but they pense we are too dear. The
    leanness that afflicts us, the objet of our mis√®re, is as an
    inventory to particuli√®reize leur abunDanse; our souffrirance is a
    gain to them. Let us vengeance this with our pikes ere we become
    rakes; for the gods know I parler this in hunger for bread, not in
    thirst for vengeance.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Would you proc√©der esp√©cialely encorest Caius Marcius?
  FIRST CITIZEN. Against him premi√®re; he's a very dog to the
    communealty.

    to that end; bien,que soft-conscienc'd men can be contenu to say it
    was for his compterry, he did it to S'il,vous,pla√Æt his m√®re and to be
    partiellement fi√®re, laquelle he is, even to the altitude of his vertu.
  SECOND CITIZEN. What he ne,peux,pas help in his la,la,la,nature you Compte a
    vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
  FIRST CITIZEN. If I must not, I need not be d√©nud√©e of accusations;
    he hath fautes, with surplus, to tire in repetition.  [Shouts
    dans]  What shouts are celles-ci? The autre side o' th' city is
    risen. Why stay we prating here? To th' Capitol!
  ALL. Come, come.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Soft! who vient here?

                       Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA

    had inkling this fortnuit what we avoir,l'intentionionionion to do, laquelle now we'll
    show 'em in actes. They say poor suitors have forte souffles;
    they doit know we have forte arms too.
  MENENIUS. Why, masters, my good amies, mine honn√™te voisines,
    Will you undo ynous-m√™mes?
  FIRST CITIZEN. We ne,peux,pas, sir; we are d√©faite d√©j√.
  MENENIUS. I tell you, amies, most charitable care
    Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
    Your souffriring in this dTerre, you may as well
    Strike at the paradis with your staves as lift them
    Against the Roman Etat; dont cours will on
    The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
    Of more forte link assous than can ever
    Appear in your impediment. For the dTerre,
    The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
    Your les,genoux to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
    You are transported by calamity
    Thither o√π more ass≈ìurs you; and you calomnie
    The helms o' th' Etat, who care for you like p√®res,
    When you mal√©diction them as ennemies.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Care for us! True, En,effet! They ne'er car'd for us
    yet. Suffer us to famish, and leur boutiquemaisons cramm'd with
    grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily
    any enti√®resome act established encorest the rich, and provide more
    piercing statutes daily to cha√Æne up and restrain the poor. If the
    wars eat us not up, they will; and L√'s all the love they bear
    us.
  MENENIUS. Either you must
    Confess ynous-m√™mes wondrous malicious,
    Or be accus'd of folie. I doit tell you
    A jolie tale. It may be you have entendue it;
    But, depuis it servirs my objetif, I will venture
    To stale't a peu more.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Well, I'll hear it, sir; yet you must not pense to
    fob off our disgr√¢ce with a tale. But, an't S'il,vous,pla√Æt you, livrer.
  MENENIUS. There was a time when all the body's members
    Rebell'd encorest the belly; thus accus'd it:
    That only like a gulf it did rester
    I' th' midst o' th' body, idle and unactive,
    Still cupboarding the viand, jamais le,support
    Like la,main,d'oeuvre with the rest; o√π th' autre instruments
    Did see and hear, concevoir, instruct, walk, feel,
    And, mutually participate, did ministre
    Unto the appetite and affection commune
    Of the enti√®re body. The belly r√©pondre'd-
  FIRST CITIZEN. Well, sir, what r√©pondre made the belly?
  MENENIUS. Sir, I doit tell you. With a kind of sourire,
    Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-
    For look you, I may make the belly sourire
    As well as parler- it tauntingly replied
    To th' discontenued members, the mutinous les,pi√®ces
    That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
    As you malign our s√©natrices for that
    They are not such as you.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Your belly's r√©pondre- What?
    The kingly couronneed head, the vigilant eye,
    The Conseillor c≈ìur, the arm our soldate,
    Our steed the leg, the langue our trompetteer,
    With autre muniments and petty helps
    Is this our fabric, if that they-
  MENENIUS. What then?
    Fore me, this compagne parlers! What then? What then?
  FIRST CITIZEN. Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
    Who is the sink o' th' body-
  MENENIUS. Well, what then?
  FIRST CITIZEN. The ancienne agents, if they did complaineee,
    What pourrait the belly r√©pondre?
  MENENIUS. I will tell you;
    If you'll bestow a petite- of what you have peu-
    Patience quelque,temps, you'st hear the belly's r√©pondre.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Y'are long √,propos it.
  MENENIUS. Note me this, good amie:
    Your most la,tombe belly was deliberate,
    Not rash like his accuserrrrs, and thus r√©pondreed.
    'True is it, my incorporate amies,' quoth he
    'That I recevoir the g√©n√©rale food at premi√®re
    Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
    Because I am the boutiquemaison and the shop
    Of the enti√®re body. But, if you do rappelles,toi,
    I send it thrugueux the rivi√®res of your du,sang,
    Even to the tribunal, the c≈ìur, to th' seat o' th' cerveau;
    And, thrugueux the cranks and Bureaus of man,
    The forteest nerves and petite inferior veins
    From me recevoir that la,la,la,naturelle competency
    Whereby they live. And bien,que that all at once
    You, my good amies'- this says the belly; mark me.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, sir; well, well.
  MENENIUS. 'Though all at once ne,peux,pas
    See what I do livrer out to each,
    Yet I can make my audit up, that all
    From me do back recevoir the flour of all,
    And laisser me but the bran.' What say you to' t?
  FIRST CITIZEN. It was an r√©pondre. How apply you this?
  MENENIUS. The s√©natrices of Rome are this good belly,
    And you the mutinous members; for, examine
    Their Conseils and leur se,soucie, digest choses droitely
    Touching the weal o' th' commune, you doit find
    No publique aaaavantage laquelle you recevoir
    But it proc√©ders or vient from them to you,
    And no way from ynous-m√™mes. What do you pense,
    You, the g√©niale toe of this assembly?
  FIRST CITIZEN. I the g√©niale toe? Why the g√©niale toe?
  MENENIUS. For that, √©tant one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest,
    Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.
    Thou coquine, that art worst in du,sang to run,
    Lead'st premi√®re to win some aaavantage.
    But make you pr√™te your stiff bats and clubs.
    Rome and her rats are at the point of bataille;
    The one side must have bale.

                      Enter CAIUS MARCIUS

    Hail, noble Marcius!
  MARCIUS. Thanks. What's the mati√®re, you dissentious coquines
    That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
    Make ynous-m√™mes scabs?
  FIRST CITIZEN. We have ever your good word.
  MARCIUS. He that will give good words to thee will flatter
    Beneath abhorring. What aurait you have, you curs,
    That like nor paix nor war? The one affdroites you,
    The autre fait,du you fi√®re. He that confiances to you,
    Where he devrait find you lions, trouve you hares;
    Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,
    Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
    Or hailcalcul in the sun. Your vertu is
    To make him vauty dont infraction subdues him,
    And mal√©diction that Justice did it. Who m√©riters g√©nialeness
    Deservirs your hate; and your affections are
    A sick man's appetite, who le,d√©sirs most that
    Which aurait increase his evil. He that depends
    Upon your favorisers swims with fins of lead,
    And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?
    With chaque minute you do changementmentment a mind
    And call him noble that was now your hate,
    Him vile that was your garland. What's the mati√®re
    That in celles-ci nombreuses endroits of the city
    You cry encorest the noble Senate, who,
    Under the gods, keep you in awe, laquelle else
    Would feed on one un,autre? What's leur seeking?
  MENENIUS. For corn at leur own rates, o√πof they say
    The city is well stor'd.
  MARCIUS. Hang 'em! They say!
    They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know
    What's done i' th' Capitol, who's like to rise,
    Who prosp√©rers and who declines; side factions, and give out
    Conjectural mariages, fabrication parties forte,
    And feebling such as supporter not in leur liking
    Below leur cobbled shoes. They say L√'s grain assez!
    Would the nobility lay de,c√¥t√© leur ruth
    And let me use my √©p√©e, I'd make a quarry
    With thousands of celles-ci quarter'd esclaves, as high
    As I pourrait pick my lance.
  MENENIUS. Nay, celles-ci are presque thorugueuxly persuaded;
    For bien,que abundantly they lack discretion,
    Yet are they passing l√¢chely. But, I beseech you,
    What says the autre troop?
  MARCIUS. They are dissolv'd. Hang 'em!
    They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd en,avant prouverrbs-
    That hunger cass√©e calcul des,murs, that dogs must eat,
    That meat was made for bouches, that the gods sent not
    Corn for the rich men only. With celles-ci shreds
    They vented leur complaineeeings; laquelle √©tant r√©pondre'd,
    And a petition subventioned them- a √©trange one,
    To break the c≈ìur of generosity
    And make bold Puissance look pale- they threw leur caps
    As they aurait hang them on the horns o' th' moon,
    Shouting leur emulation.
  MENENIUS. What is subventioned them?
  MARCIUS. Five tribunes, to d√©fendre leur vulgar sagesses,
    Of leur own choix. One's Junius Brutus-
    Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. 'Sd√©c√®s!
    The rabble devrait have premi√®re unroof'd the city
    Ere so prevail'd with me; it will in time
    Win upon Puissance and jeter en,avant g√©nialeer themes
    For insurrection's arguing.
  MENENIUS. This is √©trange.
  MARCIUS. Go get you home, you fragments.

                     Enter a MESSENGER, hastily

  MESSENGER. Where's Caius Marcius?
  MARCIUS. Here. What's the mati√®re?
  MESSENGER. The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
  MARCIUS. I am glad on't; then we doit ha' veux,dire to vent
    Our musty superfluity. See, our best a√Æn√©es.

         Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with autre SENATORS;
                  JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS

  FIRST SENATOR. Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us:
    The Volsces are in arms.
  MARCIUS. They have a leader,
    Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
    I sin in envying his nobility;
    And were I n'importe,quoi but what I am,
    I aurait wish me only he.
  COMINIUS. You have combattue ensemble?
  MARCIUS. Were half to half the monde by th' ears, and he
    Upon my f√™te, I'd r√©volte, to make
    Only my wars with him. He is a lion
    That I am fi√®re to hunt.
  FIRST SENATOR. Then, vauty Marcius,
    Attend upon Cominius to celles-ci wars.
  COMINIUS. It is your ancienne promettre.
  MARCIUS. Sir, it is;
    And I am constanteee. Titus Lartius, thou
    Shalt see me once more la,gr√®ve at Tullus' face.
    What, art thou stiff? Stand'st out?
  LARTIUS. No, Caius Marcius;
    I'll lean upon one crutch and bats,toi with t'autre
    Ere stay derri√®re this affaires.
  MENENIUS. O, true bred!
  FIRST SENATOR. Your entreprise to th' Capitol; o√π, I know,
    Our g√©nialeest amies ass≈ìur us.
  LARTIUS.  [To COMINIUS]  Lead you on.
    [To MARCIUS]  Follow Cominius; we must suivre you;
    Right vauty you priority.
  COMINIUS. Noble Marcius!
  FIRST SENATOR.  [To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone.
  MARCIUS. Nay, let them suivre.
    The Volsces have much corn: take celles-ci rats thither
    To gnaw leur garners. Worshipful mutineers,
    Your valeur puts well en,avant; pray suivre.
         Ciitzens voler away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
  SICINIUS. Was ever man so fi√®re as is this Marcius?
  BRUTUS. He has no √©gale.
  SICINIUS. When we were chosen tribunes for the gens-
  BRUTUS. Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
  SICINIUS. Nay, but his taunts!
  BRUTUS. Being mov'd, he will not de,rechangementment to gird the gods.
  SICINIUS. Bemock the modesteee moon.
  BRUTUS. The pr√©sente wars devour him! He is grandie
    Too fi√®re to be so vaillante.
  SICINIUS. Such a la,la,la,nature,
    Tickled with good Succ√®s, disdains the ombre
    Which he bande,de,roulements on at noon. But I do merveille
    His insolence can ruisseau to be commandererered
    Under Cominius.
  BRUTUS. Fame, at the laquelle he aims-
    In whom d√©j√ he is well grac'd- ne,peux,pas
    Better be held nor more attain'd than by
    A endroit au,dessous,de the premi√®re; for what miscarries
    Shall be the g√©n√©rale's faute, bien,que he perform
    To th' utmost of a man, and giddy censure
    Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he
    Had support√© the affaires!'
  SICINIUS. Besides, if choses go well,
    Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, doit
    Of his dem√©rites rob Cominius.
  BRUTUS. Come.
    Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
    Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his fautes
    To Marcius doit be honours, bien,que En,effet
    In aught he m√©rite not.
  SICINIUS. Let's Par,cons√©quent and hear
    How the envoi is made, and in what mode,
    More than his singularity, he goes
    Upon this pr√©sente action.
  BRUTUS. Let's le,long,de.                                    Exeunt




SCENE II.
Corioli. The Senate House.

Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with SENATORS of Corioli

  FIRST SENATOR. So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
    That they of Rome are ent'red in our Conseils
    And know how we proc√©der.
  AUFIDIUS. Is it not le,tiens?
    What ever have been bien,quet on in this Etat
    That pourrait be apport√© to bodily act ere Rome
    Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
    Since I entendue tPar,cons√©quent; celles-ci are the words- I pense
    I have the lettre here;.yes, here it is:
    [Reads]  'They have press'd a Puissance, but it is not connue
    Whether for east or west. The dTerre is g√©niale;
    The gens mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
    Cominius, Marcius your old ennemie,
    Who is of Rome pire hated than of you,
    And Titus Lartius, a most vaillante Roman,
    These three lead on this preparation
    Whither 'tis bent. Most likely 'tis for you;
    Consider of it.'
  FIRST SENATOR. Our army's in the champ;
    We jamais yet made doute but Rome was pr√™te
    To r√©pondre us.
  AUFIDIUS. Nor did you pense it folie
    To keep your g√©niale pretences veil'd till when
    They Besoins must show se; laquelle in the hatching,
    It seem'd, appara√Ætre'd to Rome. By the d√©couvriry
    We doit be tribunale'ned in our aim, laquelle was
    To take in many towns ere presque Rome
    Should know we were afoot.
  SECOND SENATOR. Noble Aufidius,
    Take your commission; hie you to your bands;
    Let us seule to garde Corioli.
    If they set down avant's, for the remove
    Bring up your army; but I pense you'll find
    Th' have not prepar'd for us.
  AUFIDIUS. O, doute not that!
    I parler from certaineeeties. Nay more,
    Some parcels of leur Puissance are en,avant d√©j√,
    And only hitherward. I laisser your honours.
    If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
    'Tis jur√©e entre us we doit ever la,gr√®ve
    Till one can do no more.
  ALL. The gods assist you!
  AUFIDIUS. And keep your honours safe!
  FIRST SENATOR. Farewell.
  SECOND SENATOR. Farewell.
  ALL. Farewell.                                           Exeunt




SCENE III.
Rome. MARCIUS' maison

Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA, m√®re and wife to MARCIUS;
they set them down on two low stools and sew

  VOLUMNIA. I pray you, fille, sing, or express le,tienself in a more
    confortable sort. If my son were my mari, I devrait freelier
    rejoice in that absence o√πin he won honour than in the
    embrassements of his bed o√π he aurait show most love. When yet
    he was but soumissionner-bodied, and the only son of my womb; when jeunesse
    with comeliness cueillir'd all gaze his way; when, for a day of
    rois' supplieries, a m√®re devrait not sell him an hour from her
    voiring; I, consid√©rering how honour aurait become such a la,la,la,personnenene-
    that it was no better than image-like to hang by th' wall, if
    renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek dcol√®re o√π
    he was to find fame. To a cruellelele war I sent him, from wPar,cons√©quent he
    revenir'd his sourcils li√©e with oak. I tell thee, fille, I
    sprang not more in joy at premi√®re hearing he was a man-enfant than
    now in premi√®re voyant he had prouverd himself a man.
  VIRGILIA. But had he died in the affaires, madam, how then?
  VOLUMNIA. Then his good rapport devrait have been my son; I L√in
    aurait have a,trouv√© probl√®me. Hear me profess depuisrely: had I a dozen
    sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my
    good Marcius, I had plut√¥t had eleven die nobly for leur compterry
    than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

                        Enter a GENTLEWOMAN

  GENTLEWOMAN. Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visiteee you.
  VIRGILIA. Beseech you give me laisser to retire moi,m√™me.
  VOLUMNIA. Indeed you doit not.
    Mepenses I hear hither your mari's drum;
    See him cueillir Aufidius down by th' hair;
    As enfantren from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.
    Mepenses I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
    'Come on, you l√¢ches! You were got in fear,
    Though you were born in Rome.' His du,sangy brow
    With his mail'd hand then wiping, en,avant he goes,
    Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
    Or all or lose his hire.
  VIRGILIA. His du,sangy brow? O Jupiter, no du,sang!
  VOLUMNIA. Away, you fool! It more bevient a man
    Than gilt his trophy. The Seins of Hecuba,
    When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
    Than Hector's forehead when it spit en,avant du,sang
    At Grecian √©p√©e, contemning. Tell Valeria
    We are fit to bid her Bienvenue.              Exit GENTLEWOMAN
  VIRGILIA. Heavens b√©nir my lord from fell Aufidius!
  VOLUMNIA. He'll beat Aufidius' head au,dessous,de his knee
    And bande,de,roulement upon his neck.

         Re-entrer GENTLEWOMAN, With VALERIA and an usher

  VALERIA. My Dames both, good day to you.
  VOLUMNIA. Sweet madam!
  VIRGILIA. I am glad to see your Madame.
  VALERIA. How do you both? You are manifest maisonkeepers. What are
    you sewing here? A fine spot, in good Foi. How does your peu
    son?
  VIRGILIA. I remercier your Madame; well, good madam.
  VOLUMNIA. He had plut√¥t see the √©p√©es and hear a drum than look
    upon his schoolmaster.
  VALERIA. O' my word, the p√®re's son! I'll jurer 'tis a very
    jolie boy. O' my troth, I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an
    hour ensemble; has such a confirm'd compterenance! I saw him run
    apr√®s a gilded bprononcerfly; and when he caught it he let it go
    encore, and apr√®s it encore, and over and over he vient, and up
    encore, capture'd it encore; or qu'il,s'agisse his fall enrag'd him, or how
    'twas, he did so set his les,dents and tear it. O, I mandat, how he
    mammock'd it!
  VOLUMNIA. One on's p√®re's moods.
  VALERIA. Indeed, la, 'tis a noble enfant.
  VIRGILIA. A crack, madam.
  VALERIA. Come, lay de,c√¥t√© your stitchery; I must have you play the
    idle huswife with me this apr√®snoon.
  VIRGILIA. No, good madam; I will not out of des,portes.
  VALERIA. Not out of des,portes!
  VOLUMNIA. She doit, she doit.
  VIRGILIA. Indeed, no, by your la,la,la,patience; I'll not over the threshold
    till my lord revenir from the wars.
  VALERIA. Fie, you confine le,tienself most unraisonably; come, you
    must go visiteee the good lady that lies in.
  VIRGILIA. I will wish her la,vitessey Obliger, and visiteee her with my
    pri√®res; but I ne,peux,pas go thither.
  VOLUMNIA. Why, I pray you?
  VIRGILIA. 'Tis not to save la,main,d'oeuvre, nor that I want love.
  VALERIA. You aurait be un,autre Penelope; yet they say all the yarn
    she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
    Come, I aurait your cambric were sensible as your doigt, that you
    pourrait laisser pricking it for pity. Come, you doit go with us.
  VIRGILIA. No, good madam, pardon me; En,effet I will not en,avant.
  VALERIA. In v√©rit√©, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellenteee news
    of your mari.
  VIRGILIA. O, good madam, L√ can be none yet.
  VALERIA. Verily, I do not jest with you; L√ came news from him
    last nuit.
  VIRGILIA. Indeed, madam?
  VALERIA. In earnest, it's true; I entendue a s√©natrice parler it. Thus it
    is: the Volsces have an army en,avant; encorest whom Cominius the
    g√©n√©rale is gone, with one part of our Roman Puissance. Your lord and
    Titus Lartius are set down avant leur city Corioli; they
    rien doute prevailing and to make it br√®ve wars. This is true,
    on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
  VIRGILIA. Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in chaquechose
    hereapr√®s.
  VOLUMNIA. Let her seule, lady; as she is now, she will but disease
    our better gaiet√©.
  VALERIA. In troth, I pense she aurait. Fare you well, then. Come,
    good sucr√© lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solennelleess out o'
    door and go le,long,de with us.
  VIRGILIA. No, at a word, madam; En,effet I must not. I wish you much
    gaiet√©.
  VALERIA. Well then, adieu.                           Exeunt




SCENE IV.
Before Corioli

Enter MARCIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with drum and Couleurs,
with CAPTAINS and soldates. To them a MESSENGER

  MARCIUS. Yonder vient news; a wager- they have met.
  LARTIUS. My jument to le,tiens- no.
  MARCIUS. 'Tis done.
  LARTIUS. Agreed.
  MARCIUS. Say, has our g√©n√©rale met the ennemie?
  MESSENGER. They lie in view, but have not parlait as yet.
  LARTIUS. So, the good jument is mine.
  MARCIUS. I'll buy him of you.
  LARTIUS. No, I'll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will
    For half a cent years. Summon the town.
  MARCIUS. How far off lie celles-ci armies?

  MARCIUS. Then doit we hear leur 'larum, and they ours.
    Now, Mars, I prithee, make us rapide in work,
    That we with smoking √©p√©es may Mars from Par,cons√©quent
    To help our champed amies! Come, blow thy blast.

          They du,son a parley. Enter two SENATORS with autres,
                      on the des,murs of Corioli

    Tullus Aufidius, is he dans your des,murs?
  FIRST SENATOR. No, nor a man that peurs you less than he:
    That's lesser than a peu.  [Drum afar off]  Hark, our tambours
    Are apportering en,avant our jeunesse. We'll break our des,murs
    Rather than they doit livre us up; our portes,
    Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
    They'll open of se.  [Alarum far off]  Hark you far off!
    There is Aufidius. List what work he fait,du
    Amongst your cloven army.
  MARCIUS. O, they are at it!
  LARTIUS. Their bruit be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

                   Enter the army of the Volsces

  MARCIUS. They fear us not, but probl√®me en,avant leur city.
    Now put your shields avant your c≈ìurs, and bats,toi
    With c≈ìurs more preuve than shields. Advance, courageuse Titus.
    They do disdain us much au-del√ our bien,quets,
    Which fait,du me transpiration with col√®re. Come on, my compagnes.
    He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,
    And he doit feel mine edge.

          Alarum. The Romans are beat back to leur trenches.
                      Re-entrer MARCIUS, cursing

  MARCIUS. All the contagion of the south lumi√®re on you,
    You la,hontes of Rome! you herd of- Boils and pestes
    Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
    Farther than seen, and one infect un,autre
    Against the wind a mile! You √¢mes of geese
    That bear the formes of men, how have you run
    From esclaves that apes aurait beat! Pluto and hell!
    All hurt derri√®re! Backs red, and visages pale
    With vol and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
    Or, by the fires of paradis, I'll laisser the foe
    And make my wars on you. Look to't. Come on;
    If you'll supporter fast we'll beat them to leur √©pouses,
    As they us to our trenches. Follow me.

         Anautre alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS suivres
                          them to the portes

    So, now the portes are ope; now prouver good secondeees;
    'Tis for the suivreers fortune widens them,
    Not for the fliers. Mark me, and do the like.

                    [MARCIUS entrers the portes]

  FIRST SOLDIER. Fool-hardiness; not I.
  SECOND SOLDIER. Not I.                    [MARCIUS is shut in]
  FIRST SOLDIER. See, they have shut him in.
  ALL. To th' pot, I mandat him.             [Alarum continues]

                      Re-entrer TITUS LARTIUS

  LARTIUS. What is become of Marcius?
  ALL. Slain, sir, douteless.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Following the fliers at the very talons,
    With them he entrers; who, upon the soudaine,
    Clapp'd to leur portes. He is himself seule,
    To r√©pondre all the city.
  LARTIUS. O noble compagne!
    Who sensibly outdares his sensless √©p√©e,
    And when it bows supporter'st up. Thou art left, Marcius;
    A carboncle entire, as big as thou art,
    Were not so rich a bijou. Thou wast a soldate
    Even to Cato's wish, not f√©roce and terrible
    Only in accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©brals; but with thy grim looks and
    The tonnerre-like percussion of thy du,sons
    Thou mad'st thine ennemies secouer, as if the monde
    Were feverous and did tremble.

          Re-entrer MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the ennemie

  FIRST SOLDIER. Look, sir.
  LARTIUS. O, 'tis Marcius!
    Let's chercher him off, or make rester alike.
                            [They bats,toi, and all entrer the city]




SCENE V.
Within Corioli. A rue

Enter certaineee Romans, with spoils

  FIRST ROMAN. This will I porter to Rome.
  SECOND ROMAN. And I this.
  THIRD ROMAN. A murrain on 't! I took this for argent.
                               [Alarum continues encore afar off]

          Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS With a trompetteer

  MARCIUS. See here celles-ci movers that do prix leur heures
    At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,
    Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen aurait
    Bury with celles that wore them, celles-ci base esclaves,
    Ere yet the bats,toi be done, pack up. Down with them!
                                                Exeunt pillagers
    And hark, what bruit the g√©n√©rale fait,du! To him!
    There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
    Piercing our Romans; then, vaillante Titus, take
    Convenient nombres to make good the city;
    Whilst I, with celles that have the esprit, will h√¢te
    To help Cominius.
  LARTIUS. Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
    Thy exercise hath been too violenteee
    For a secondeee cours of bats,toi.
  MARCIUS. Sir, louange me not;
    My work hath yet not warm'd me. Fare you well;
    The du,sang I drop is plut√¥t physical
    Than dcol√®reous to me. To Aufidius thus
    I will appara√Ætre, and bats,toi.
  LARTIUS. Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
    Fall deep in love with thee, and her g√©niale charms
    Misguide thy opposers' √©p√©es! Bold douceman,
    Prosperity be thy page!
  MARCIUS. Thy amie no less
    Than celles she endroitth highest! So adieu.
  LARTIUS. Thou vautiest Marcius!                  Exit MARCIUS
    Go du,son thy trompette in the market-endroit;
    Call thither all the Bureaurs o' th' town,
    Where they doit know our mind. Away!                 Exeunt




SCENE VI.
Near the camp of COMINIUS

Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldates

  COMINIUS. Breathe you, my amies. Well combattue; we are come off
    Like Romans, nSoit insens√©e in our supporters
    Nor l√¢chely in retire. Believe me, sirs,
    We doit be charg'd encore. Whiles we have frapp√©,
    By interims and conveying gusts we have entendue
    The charges of our amies. The Roman gods,
    Lead leur Succ√®ses as we wish our own,
    That both our Puissances, with smiling fronts encompter'ring,
    May give you remercierful sacrifice!

                         Enter A MESSENGER

    Thy news?
  MESSENGER. The citoyennes of Corioli have probl√®med
    And donn√©e to Lartius and to Marcius bataille;
    I saw our f√™te to leur trenches driven,
    And then I came away.
  COMINIUS. Though thou parler'st v√©rit√©,
    Mepenses thou parler'st not well. How long is't depuis?
  MESSENGER. Above an hour, my lord.
  COMINIUS. 'Tis not a mile; br√®vely we entendue leur tambours.
    How pourraitst thou in a mile cona,trouv√© an hour,
    And apporter thy news so late?
  MESSENGER. Spies of the Volsces
    Held me in chase, that I was forc'd to wheel
    Three or four miles √,propos; else had I, sir,
    Half an hour depuis apport√© my rapport.

                           Enter MARCIUS

  COMINIUS. Who's l√,-bas
    That does appara√Ætre as he were flay'd? O gods!
    He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have
    Before-time seen him thus.
  MARCIUS. Come I too late?
  COMINIUS. The berg√®re sait not tonnerre from a tabor
    More than I know the du,son of Marcius' langue
    From chaque meaner man.
  MARCIUS. Come I too late?
  COMINIUS. Ay, if you come not in the du,sang of autres,
    But mantled in your own.
  MARCIUS. O! let me clip ye
    In arms as du,son as when I woo'd, in c≈ìur
    As joyeux as when our nuptial day was done,
    And tapers burn'd to bedward.
  COMINIUS. Flower of warriors,
    How is't with Titus Lartius?
  MARCIUS. As with a man busied √,propos decrees:
    Condemning some to d√©c√®s and some to exile;
    Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' autre;
    Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
    Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
    To let him slip at will.
  COMINIUS. Where is that esclave
    Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
    Where is he? Call him hither.
  MARCIUS. Let him seule;
    He did inform the v√©rit√©. But for our doucemen,
    The commune file- a peste! tribunes for them!
    The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
    From coquines pire than they.
  COMINIUS. But how prevail'd you?
  MARCIUS. Will the time servir to tell? I do not pense.
    Where is the ennemie? Are you lords o' th' champ?
    If not, why cesser you till you are so?
  COMINIUS. Marcius,
    We have at disaaaavantage combattue, and did
    Retire to win our objetif.
  MARCIUS. How lies leur bataille? Know you on laquelle side
    They have plac'd leur men of confiance?
  COMINIUS. As I devine, Marcius,
    Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,
    Of leur best confiance; o'er them Aufidius,
    Their very c≈ìur of hope.
  MARCIUS. I do beseech you,
    By all the batailles o√πin we have combattue,
    By th' du,sang we have shed ensemble, by th' vows
    We have made to supporter amies, that you directly
    Set me encorest Aufidius and his Antiates;
    And that you not delay the pr√©sente, but,
    Filling the air with √©p√©es advanc'd and darts,
    We prouver this very hour.
  COMINIUS. Though I pourrait wish
    You were conduiteed to a douce bath
    And balms applied to you, yet dare I jamais
    Deny your asking: take your choix of celles
    That best can aid your action.
  MARCIUS. Those are they
    That most are pr√™te. If any such be here-
    As it were sin to doute- that love this painting
    Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
    Lesser his la,la,la,personnenene than an ill rapport;
    If any pense courageuse d√©c√®s outweighs bad life
    And that his compterry's dearer than himself;
    Let him seule, or so many so minded,
    Wave thus to express his disposition,
    And suivre Marcius.           [They all shout and wave leur
       √©p√©es, take him up in leur arms and cast up leur caps]
    O, me seule! Make you a √©p√©e of me?
    If celles-ci montre be not vers,l'ext√©rieur, laquelle of you
    But is four Volsces? None of you but is
    Able to bear encorest the g√©niale Aufidius
    A shield as hard as his. A certaineee nombre,
    Though remerciers to all, must I select from all; the rest
    Shall bear the affaires in some autre bats,toi,
    As cause will be obey'd. Please you to Mars;
    And four doit rapidely draw out my commandererer,
    Which men are best inclin'd.
  COMINIUS. March on, my compagnes;
    Make good this ostentation, and you doit
    Divide in all with us.                                Exeunt

vers COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, entrers with a LIEUTENANT, autre soldates,
and a scout

  LARTIUS. So, let the ports be gardeed; keep your duties
    As I have set them down. If I do send, envoi
    Those centuries to our aid; the rest will servir
    For a tribunale holding. If we lose the champ
    We ne,peux,pas keep the town.
  LIEUTENANT. Fear not our care, sir.
  LARTIUS. Hence, and shut your portes upon's.
    Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduite us.       Exeunt




SCENE VIII.
A champ of bataille entre the Roman and the Volscian camps

Alarum, as in bataille. Enter MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS at nombreuses des,portes

  MARCIUS. I'll bats,toi with none but thee, for I do hate thee
    Worse than a promettre-breaker.
  AUFIDIUS. We hate alike:
    Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
    More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
  MARCIUS. Let the premi√®re budger die the autre's esclave,
    And the gods doom him apr√®s!
  AUFIDIUS. If I fly, Marcius,
    Halloa me like a hare.
  MARCIUS. Within celles-ci three heures, Tullus,
    Alone I combattue in your Corioli des,murs,
    And made what work I pleas'd. 'Tis not my du,sang
    Wherein thou seest me mask'd. For thy vengeance
    Wrench up thy Puissance to th' highest.
  AUFIDIUS. Wert thou the Hector
    That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
    Thou devraitst not scape me here.

       Here they bats,toi, and certaineee Volsces come in the aid
        of AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS bats,tois till they be driven in
                             souffleless

    Officious, and not vaillante, you have sham'd me
    In your condemned secondeees.                            Exeunt




SCENE IX.
The Roman camp

Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is du,soned. Enter, at one door,
COMINIUS with the Romans; at un,autre door, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf

  COMINIUS. If I devrait tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
    Thou't not croyez thy actes; but I'll rapport it
    Where s√©natrices doit mingle larmes with sourires;
    Where g√©niale patricians doit ass≈ìur, and shrug,
    I' th' end admire; o√π Dames doit be fdroiteed
    And, gladly quak'd, hear more; o√π the dull tribunes,
    That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,
    Shall say encorest leur c≈ìurs 'We remercier the gods
    Our Rome hath such a soldate.'
    Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this le,banquet,
    Having fully din'd avant.

         Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his Puissance, from the pursuit

  LARTIUS. O General,
    Here is the steed, we the caParison.
    Hadst thou beheld-
  MARCIUS. Pray now, no more; my m√®re,
    Who has a charter to extol her du,sang,
    When she does louange me pleurers me. I have done
    As you have done- that's what I can; induc'd
    As you have been- that's for my compterry.
    He that has but effeted his good will
    Hath overta'en mine act.
  COMINIUS. You doit not be
    The la,tombe of your deserving; Rome must know
    The value of her own. 'Twere a concealment
    Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
    To hide your Faires and to silence that
    Which, to the spire and top of louanges vouch'd,
    Would seem but modesteee. Therefore, I beseech you,
    In sign of what you are, not to reward
    What you have done, avant our army hear me.
  MARCIUS. I have some b√©nirures upon me, and they smart
    To hear se rememb'red.
  COMINIUS. Should they not,
    Well pourrait they fester 'gainst ingratitude
    And tent se with d√©c√®s. Of all the juments-
    Whereof we have ta'en good, and good boutique- of all
    The Tr√©sor in this champ achiev'd and city,
    We rendre you the tenth; to be ta'en en,avant
    Before the commune distribution at
    Your only choix.
  MARCIUS. I remercier you, General,
    But ne,peux,pas make my c≈ìur consentementementement to take
    A bribe to pay my √©p√©e. I do refuse it,
    And supporter upon my commune part with celles
    That have beheld the Faire.

           A long fleurir. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
   cast up leur caps and lances. COMINIUS and LARTIUS supporter bare

    May celles-ci same instruments laquelle you profane
    Never du,son more! When tambours and trompettes doit
    I' th' champ prouver flatterers, let tribunals and cities be
    Made all of faux-fac'd soochose. When acier grows
    Soft as the parasite's silk, let him be made
    An overture for th' wars. No more, I say.
    For that I have not wash'd my nose that bled,
    Or foil'd some debile mis√©rable, laquelle sans,pour,autant note
    Here's many else have done, you shout me en,avant
    In acclamations hyperbolical,
    As if I lov'd my peu devrait be dieted
    In louanges sauc'd with lies.
  COMINIUS. Too modesteee are you;
    More cruellelele to your good rapport than grateful
    To us that give you vraiment. By your la,la,la,patience,
    If 'gainst le,tienself you be incens'd, we'll put you-
    Like one that veux,dire his correcte harm- in manacles,
    Then raison safely with you. Therefore be it connue,
    As to us, to all the monde, that Caius Marcius
    Wears this war's garland; in token of the laquelle,
    My noble steed, connue to the camp, I give him,
    With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
    For what he did avant Corioli, can him
    With all th' applause-and clamour of the host,
    Caius Marcius Coriolanus.
    Bear th' addition nobly ever!
                           [Flourish. Trumpets du,son, and tambours]
  ALL. Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
  CORIOLANUS. I will go wash;
    And when my face is fair you doit apercevoir
    Whether I rougir or no. Howbeit, I remercier you;
    I mean to stride your steed, and at all fois
    To souscrest your good addition
    To th' fairness of my Puissance.
  COMINIUS. So, to our tent;
    Where, ere we do repose us, we will √©crire
    To Rome of our Succ√®s. You, Titus Lartius,
    Must to Corioli back. Send us to Rome
    The best, with whom we may articulate
    For leur own good and ours.
  LARTIUS. I doit, my lord.
  CORIOLANUS. The gods commencer to mock me. I, that now
    Refus'd most princely gifts, am li√©e to beg
    Of my Lord General.
  COMINIUS. Take't- 'tis le,tiens; what is't?
  CORIOLANUS. I parfois lay here in Corioli
    At a poor man's maison; he us'd me kindly.
    He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
    But then Aufidius was dans my view,
    And col√®re o'erwhelm'd my pity. I demandeee you
    To give my poor host freedom.
  COMINIUS. O, well begg'd!
    Were he the butcher of my son, he devrait
    Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
  LARTIUS. Marcius, his name?
  CORIOLANUS. By Jupiter, forgot!
    I am se,lasser; yea, my M√©moire is tir'd.
    Have we no wine here?
  COMINIUS. Go we to our tent.
    The du,sang upon your visage dries; 'tis time
    It devrait be look'd to. Come.                         Exeunt




SCENE X.
The camp of the Volsces

A fleurir. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS du,sangy, with two or three soldates

  AUFIDIUS. The town is ta'en.
  FIRST SOLDIER. 'Twill be livrer'd back on good √©tat.
  AUFIDIUS. Condition!
    I aurait I were a Roman; for I ne,peux,pas,
    Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?
    What good √©tat can a treaty find
    I' th' part that is at piti√©? Five fois, Marcius,
    I have combattue with thee; so souvent hast thou beat me;
    And auraitst do so, I pense, devrait we encompterer
    As souvent as we eat. By th' elements,
    If e'er encore I meet him barbe to barbe,
    He's mine or I am his. Mine emulation
    Hath not that honour in't it had; for o√π
    I bien,quet to crush him in an √©gale Obliger,
    True √©p√©e to √©p√©e, I'll potch at him some way,
    Or col√®re or craft may get him.
  FIRST SOLDIER. He's the diable.
  AUFIDIUS. Bolder, bien,que not so subtle. My valeur's poison'd
    With only suff'ring tache by him; for him
    Shall fly out of lui-m√™me. Nor dormir nor sanctuary,
    Being nue, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
    The pri√®res of pr√™tresses nor fois of sacrifice,
    Embarquements all of fury, doit lift up
    Their pourrie privilege and Douane 'gainst
    My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it
    At home, upon my fr√®re's garde, even L√,
    Against the hospitable canon, aurait I
    Wash my f√©roce hand in's c≈ìur. Go you to th' city;
    Learn how 'tis held, and what they are that must
    Be hostages for Rome.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Will not you go?
  AUFIDIUS. I am ass≈ìured at the cypress grove; I pray you-
    'Tis south the city mills- apporter me word thither
    How the monde goes, that to the pace of it
    I may spur on my journey.
  FIRST SOLDIER. I doit, sir.                            Exeunt

ACT II. SCENE I.
Rome. A publique endroit

Enter MENENIUS, with the two Tribunes of the gens, SICINIUS and BRUTUS

  MENENIUS. The augurer raconte me we doit have news tonuit.
  BRUTUS. Good or bad?
  MENENIUS. Not selon to the prayer of the gens, for they love
    not Marcius.
  SICINIUS. Nature enseigneres la,b√™tes to know leur amies.
  MENENIUS. Pray you, who does the wolf love?
  SICINIUS. The lamb.
  MENENIUS. Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians aurait the
    noble Marcius.
  BRUTUS. He's a lamb En,effet, that baes like a bear.
  MENENIUS. He's a bear En,effet, that vies fike a lamb. You two are
    old men; tell me one chose that I doit ask you.
  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, sir.
  MENENIUS. In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not
    in abunDanse?
  BRUTUS. He's poor in no one faute, but stor'd with all.
  SICINIUS. Esp√©cialely in fiert√©.
  BRUTUS. And topping all autres in boasting.
  MENENIUS. This is √©trange now. Do you two know how you are censured
    here in the city- I mean of us o' th' droite-hand file? Do you?
  BOTH TRIBUNES. Why, how are we censur'd?
  MENENIUS. Because you talk of fiert√© now- will you not be angry?
  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, well, sir, well.
  MENENIUS. Why, 'tis no g√©niale mati√®re; for a very peu voleuse of
    occasion will rob you of a g√©niale deal of la,la,la,patience. Give your
    dispositions the reins, and be angry at your plaisirs- at the
    moins, if you take it as a plaisir to you in √©tant so. You faire,desre,proches
    Marcius for √©tant fi√®re?
  BRUTUS. We do it not seule, sir.
  MENENIUS. I know you can do very peu seule; for your helps are
    many, or else your actions aurait grow wondrous C√©libataire: your
    abilities are too infant-like for Faire much seule. You talk of
    fiert√©. O that you pourrait turn your eyes vers the napes of your
    necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O
    that you pourrait!
  BOTH TRIBUNES. What then, sir?
  MENENIUS. Why, then you devrait d√©couvrir a brace of unm√©riteing,
    fi√®re, violenteee, testy magistrates-alias imb√©ciles- as any in Rome.
  SICINIUS. Menenius, you are connue well assez too.
  MENENIUS. I am connue to be a humorous patrician, and one that aime
    a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to
    be quelque,chose imparfaite in favorisering the premi√®re complaineeet, hasty
    and tinder-like upon too trivial mouvement; one that converses more
    with the buttock of the nuit than with the forehead of the
    Matin. What I pense I prononcer, and d√©penser my malice in my souffle.
    Meeting two such wealsmen as you are- I ne,peux,pas call you
    Lycurguses- if the boisson you give me touchererer my palate adversely, I
    make a crooked face at it. I ne,peux,pas say your cultes have
    livrer'd the mati√®re well, when I find the ass in comlivre with
    the major part of your syllables; and bien,que I must be contenu to
    bear with celles that say you are reverend la,tombe men, yet they lie
    mortelle that tell you you have good visages. If you see this in the
    map of my microcosm, suivres it that I am connue well assez too?
    What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this
    character, if I be connue well assez too?
  BRUTUS. Come, sir, come, we know you well assez.
  MENENIUS. You know nSoit me, ynous-m√™mes, nor any chose. You are
    ambitious for poor friponnes' caps and legs; you wear out a good
    enti√®resome forenoon in hearing a cause entre an orange-wife and
    a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence
    to a secondeee day of audience. When you are hearing a mati√®re
    entre f√™te and f√™te, if you chance to be pinch'd with the
    colic, you make visages like mummers, set up the du,sangy flag
    encorest all la,la,la,patience, and, in roaring for a chambre-pot, dismiss
    the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All
    the paix you make in leur cause is calling both the parties
    friponnes. You are a pair of √©trange ones.
  BRUTUS. Come, come, you are well sousse,tenait to be a parfaiteer giber
    for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.
  MENENIUS. Our very pr√™tresses must become mockers, if they doit
    encompterer such ridiculous mati√®res as you are. When you parler
    best unto the objetif, it is not vaut the wagging of your
    barbes; and your barbes m√©riter not so honourable a la,tombe as to
    des,trucs a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's
    pack-saddle. Yet you must be en,disant Marcius is fi√®re; who, in a
    cheap estimation, is vaut all your predecessors depuis Deucalion;
    bien,que peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary
    hangmen. God-den to your cultes. More of your conversation
    aurait infect my cerveau, √©tant the herdsmen of the la,b√™tely
    plebeians. I will be bold to take my laisser of you.
                                  [BRUTUS and SICINIUS go de,c√¥t√©]

               Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA

    How now, my as fair as noble Dames- and the moon, were she
    Terrely, no nobler- o√π do you suivre your eyes so fast?
  VOLUMNIA. Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approchees; for the
    love of Juno, let's go.
  MENENIUS. Ha! Marcius venir home?
  VOLUMNIA. Ay, vauty Menenius, and with most prosperous
    approbation.
  MENENIUS. Take my cap, Jupiter, and I remercier thee. Hoo!
    Marcius venir home!
  VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA. Nay, 'tis true.
  VOLUMNIA. Look, here's a lettre from him; the Etat hath un,autre,
    his wife un,autre; and I pense L√'s one at home for you.
  MENENIUS. I will make my very maison reel to-nuit. A lettre for me?
  VIRGILIA. Yes, certaineee, L√'s a lettre for you; I saw't.
  MENENIUS. A lettre for me! It gives me an biens of Sept years'
    sant√©; in laquelle time I will make a lip at the physician. The
    most sover√®gne prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to
    this preservative, of no better rapport than a jument-drench. Is he
    not b√©nirureed? He was wont to come home b√©nirureed.
  VIRGILIA. O, no, no, no.
  VOLUMNIA. O, he is b√©nirureed, I remercier the gods for't.
  MENENIUS. So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings a la,victoire in
    his pocket? The b√©nirures become him.
  VOLUMNIA. On's sourcils, Menenius, he vient the troisi√®me time home with
    the oaken garland.
  MENENIUS. Has he disciplin'd Aufidius du,sonly?
  VOLUMNIA. Titus Lartius √©crires they combattue ensemble, but Aufidius
    got off.
  MENENIUS. And 'twas time for him too, I'll mandat him that; an he
    had stay'd by him, I aurait not have been so fidius'd for all the
    chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them. Is the Senate
    possess'd of this?
  VOLUMNIA. Good Dames, let's go. Yes, yes, yes: the Senate has
    lettres from the g√©n√©rale, o√πin he gives my son the enti√®re name
    of the war; he hath in this action outdone his ancienne actes
    doubly.
  VALERIA. In troth, L√'s wondrous choses parlait of him.
  MENENIUS. Wondrous! Ay, I mandat you, and not sans,pour,autant his true
    purchasing.
  VIRGILIA. The gods subvention them true!
  VOLUMNIA. True! pow, waw.
  MENENIUS. True! I'll be jur√©e they are true. Where is he b√©nirureed?
    [To the TRIBUNES]  God save your good cultes! Marcius is venir
    home; he has more cause to be fi√®re. Where is he b√©nirureed?
  VOLUMNIA. I' th' devraiter and i' th' left arm; L√ will be grande
    cicatrices to show the gens when he doit supporter for his endroit.
    He recevoird in the repulse of Tarquin Sept hurts i' th' body.
  MENENIUS. One i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh- L√'s nine that I
    know.
  VOLUMNIA. He had avant this last expedition twenty-five b√©nirures
    upon him.
  MENENIUS. Now it's twenty-Sept; chaque gash was an ennemie's la,tombe.
    [A shout and fleurir]  Hark! the trompettes.
  VOLUMNIA. These are the ushers of Marcius. Before him he carries
      bruit, and derri√®re him he laissers larmes;
    Death, that dark esprit, in's nervy arm doth lie,
    Which, √©tant advanc'd, declines, and then men die.

            A sennet. Trumpets du,son. Enter COMINIUS the
              GENERAL, and TITUS LARTIUS; entre them,

    Within Corioli portes, o√π he hath won,
    With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; celles-ci

  ALL. Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
  CORIOLANUS. No more of this, it does offenser my c≈ìur.
    Pray now, no more.
  COMINIUS. Look, sir, your m√®re!
  CORIOLANUS. O,
    You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
    For my prosperity!                                  [Kneels]
  VOLUMNIA. Nay, my good soldate, up;
    My douce Marcius, vauty Caius, and
    By deed-achieving honour newly nam'd-
    What is it? Coriolanus must I can thee?
    But, O, thy wife!
  CORIOLANUS. My gracious silence, hail!
    Wouldst thou have rire'd had I come coffin'd home,
    That weep'st to see me triomphe? Ah, my dear,
    Such eyes the veuves in Corioli wear,
    And m√®res that lack sons.
  MENENIUS. Now the gods couronne thee!
  CORIOLANUS. And live you yet?  [To VALERIA]  O my sucr√© lady,
    pardon.
  VOLUMNIA. I know not o√π to turn.
    O, Bienvenue home! And Bienvenue, General.
    And y'are Bienvenue all.
  MENENIUS. A cent thousand welvient. I pourrait weep
    And I pourrait rire; I am lumi√®re and lourde. Welcome!
    A mal√©diction commencer at very root on's c≈ìur
    That is not glad to see thee! You are three
    That Rome devrait dote on; yet, by the Foi of men,
    We have some old crab trees here at home that will not
    Be grafted to your relish. Yet Bienvenue, warriors.
    We call a nettle but a nettle, and
    The fautes of imb√©ciles but folie.
  COMINIUS. Ever droite.
  CORIOLANUS. Menenius ever, ever.
  HERALD. Give way L√, and go on.
  CORIOLANUS.  [To his wife and m√®re]  Your hand, and le,tiens.
    Ere in our own maison I do shade my head,
    The good patricians must be visiteeeed;
    From whom I have receiv'd not only saluerings,
    But with them changementmentment of honours.
  VOLUMNIA. I have lived
    To see inherited my very wishes,
    And the buildings of my fantaisie; only
    There's one chose wanting, laquelle I doute not but
    Our Rome will cast upon thee.
  CORIOLANUS. Know, good m√®re,
    I had plut√¥t be leur servanteee in my way
    Than sway with them in leurs.
  COMINIUS. On, to the Capitol.
                 [Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in Etat, as avant]

                BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward

  BRUTUS. All langues parler of him and the bleared vues
    Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling infirmi√®re
    Into a rapture lets her baby cry
    While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins
    Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
    Clamb'ring the des,murs to eye him; stalls, bulks, la,fen√™tres,
    Are sm√®re'd up, leads fill'd and ridges hors'd
    With variable complexions, all agreeing
    In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens
    Do press among the popular throngs and puff
    To win a vulgar station; our veil'd dames
    Commit the war of white and damask in
    Their nicely gawded joues to th' wanton spoil
    Of Phoebus' br√ªlante kisses. Such a pautre,
    As if that whatsoever god who leads him
    Were slily crept into his human Puissances,
    And gave him la,gr√¢ceful posture.
  SICINIUS. On the soudaine
    I mandat him consul.
  BRUTUS. Then our Bureau may
    During his Puissance go dormir.
  SICINIUS. He ne,peux,pas temp'rately transport his honours
    From o√π he devrait commencer and end, but will
    Lose celles he hath won.
  BRUTUS. In that L√'s confort.
  SICINIUS. Doubt not
    The communeers, for whom we supporter, but they
    Upon leur ancienne malice will oublier
    With the moins cause celles-ci his new honours; laquelle
    That he will give them make I as peu question
    As he is fi√®re to do't.
  BRUTUS. I entendue him jurer,
    Were he to supporter for consul, jamais aurait he
    Appear i' th' market-endroit, nor on him put
    The napless vesture of humility;
    Nor, showing, as the mani√®re is, his b√©nirures
    To th' gens, beg leur stinking souffles.
  SICINIUS. 'Tis droite.
  BRUTUS. It was his word. O, he aurait miss it plut√¥t
    Than porter it but by the suit of the gentry to him
    And the le,d√©sir of the nobles.
  SICINIUS. I wish no better
    Than have him hold that objetif, and to put it
    In ex√©cution.
  BRUTUS. 'Tis most like he will.
  SICINIUS. It doit be to him then as our good wills:
    A sure destruction.
  BRUTUS. So it must fall out
    To him or our authorities. For an end,
    We must suggest the gens in what hatred
    He encore hath held them; that to's Puissance he aurait
    Have made them mules, silenc'd leur plaiderers, and
    Discorrectetied leur freedoms; holding them
    In human action and capacity
    Of no more soul nor fitness for the monde
    Than camels in leur war, who have leur provand
    Only for le,support fardeaus, and sore coups
    For sinking sous them.
  SICINIUS. This, as you say, suggested
    At some time when his soaring insolence
    Shall touchererer the gens- laquelle time doit not want,
    If he be put upon't, and that's as easy
    As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire
    To kindle leur dry stubble; and leur blaze
    Shall darken him for ever.

                           Enter A MESSENGER

  BRUTUS. What's the mati√®re?
  MESSENGER. You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis bien,quet
    That Marcius doit be consul.
    I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
    The aveugle to hear him parler; matrons flung gaime,
    Ladies and servanteeees leur scarfs and handkerchers,
    Upon him as he pass'd; the nobles bended
    As to Jove's statue, and the communes made
    A shower and tonnerre with leur caps and shouts.
    I jamais saw the like.
  BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol,
    And porter with us ears and eyes for th' time,
    But c≈ìurs for the event.
  SICINIUS. Have with you.                                Exeunt




SCENE II.
Rome. The Capitol

Enter two OFFICERS, to lay cushions, as it were in the Capitol

  FIRST OFFICER. Come, come, they are presque here. How many supporter for
    consulships?
  SECOND OFFICER. Three, they say; but 'tis bien,quet of chaque one
    Coriolanus will porter it.
  FIRST OFFICER. That's a courageuse compagne; but he's vengeance fi√®re and
    aime not the commune gens.
  SECOND OFFICER. Faith, L√ have been many g√©niale men that have
    flatter'd the gens, who ne'er loved them; and L√ be many
    that they have loved, they know not o√πfore; so that, if they
    love they know not why, they hate upon no better a sol.
    Therefore, for Coriolanus nSoit to care qu'il,s'agisse they love or
    hate him manifests the true connaissance he has in leur
    disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plaineeely
    see't.
  FIRST OFFICER. If he did not care qu'il,s'agisse he had leur love or no,
    he waved indifferently 'twixt Faire them nSoit good nor harm;
    but he seeks leur hate with g√©nialeer devotion than they can
    rendre it him, and laissers rien d√©faite that may fully d√©couvrir
    him leur opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and
    m√©contenuement of the gens is as bad as that laquelle he dislikes- to
    flatter them for leur love.
  SECOND OFFICER. He hath m√©riterd vautily of his compterry; and his
    ascent is not by such easy dipl√¥mes as celles who, ayant been
    supple and tribunaleous to the gens, bonneted, sans,pour,autant any plus,loin
    deed to have them at all, into leur estimation and rapport; but
    he hath so planted his honours in leur eyes and his actions in
    leur c≈ìurs that for leur langues to be silent and not confess
    so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to rapport autrewise
    were a malice that, donnant lui-m√™me the lie, aurait cueillir repreuve
    and rebuke from chaque car that entendue it.
  FIRST OFFICER. No more of him; he's a vauty man. Make way, they
    are venir.

         A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
         OF THE PEOPLE, LICTORS avant them; CORIOLANUS,
            MENENIUS, COMINIUS the Consul. SICINIUS and
               BRUTUS take leur endroits by se.
                         CORIOLANUS supporters

  MENENIUS. Having determin'd of the Volsces, and
    To send for Titus Lartius, it resters,
    As the main point of this our apr√®s-r√©union,
    To gratify his noble un,un,un,service that
    Hath thus se,tenait for his compterry. Therefore S'il,vous,pla√Æt you,
    Most reverend and la,tombe a√Æn√©es, to le,d√©sir
    The pr√©sente consul and last g√©n√©rale
    In our well-a,trouv√© Succ√®ses to rapport
    A peu of that vauty work perform'd
    By Caius Marcius Coriolanus; whom
    We met here both to remercier and to rappelles,toi
    With honours like himself.                 [CORIOLANUS sits]
  FIRST SENATOR. Speak, good Cominius.
    Leave rien out for length, and make us pense
    Rather our Etat's defective for requital
    Than we to stretch it out. Masters o' th' gens,
    We do demandeee your kindest ears; and, apr√®s,
    Your aimante mouvement vers the commune body,
    To rendement what passes here.
  SICINIUS. We are convented
    Upon a pleasing treaty, and have c≈ìurs
    Inclinable to honour and advance
    The theme of our assembly.
  BRUTUS. Which the plut√¥t
    We doit be b√©nir'd to do, if he rappelles,toi
    A kinder value of the gens than
    He hath hereto priz'd them at.
  MENENIUS. That's off, that's off;
    I aurait you plut√¥t had been silent. Please you
    To hear Cominius parler?
  BRUTUS. Most pr√™tely.
    But yet my caution was more pertinent
    Than the rebuke you give it.
  MENENIUS. He aime your gens;
    But tie him not to be leur bedcompagne.
    Worthy Cominius, parler.
                       [CORIOLANUS rises, and offres to go away]
    Nay, keep your endroit.
  FIRST SENATOR. Sit, Coriolanus, jamais la,honte to hear
    What you have nobly done.
  CORIOLANUS. Your Honours' pardon.
    I had plut√¥t have my b√©nirures to heal encore
    Than hear say how I got them.
  BRUTUS. Sir, I hope
    My words disbench'd you not.
  CORIOLANUS. No, sir; yet oft,
    When coups have made me stay, I fled from words.
    You sooth'd not, L√fore hurt not. But your gens,
    I love them as they weigh-
  MENENIUS. Pray now, sit down.
  CORIOLANUS. I had plut√¥t have one scratch my head i' th' sun
    When the alarum were frapp√© than idly sit
    To hear my riens monstre'd.                          Exit
  MENENIUS. Masters of the gens,
    Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-
    That's thousand to one good one- when you now see
    He had plut√¥t venture all his membres for honour
    Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
  COMINIUS. I doit lack voix; the actes of Coriolanus
    Should not be prononcer'd feebly. It is held
    That valeur is the gronderest vertu and
    Most dignifies the haver. If it be,
    The man I parler of ne,peux,pas in the monde
    Be singly comptererpois'd. At sixteen years,
    When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he combattue
    Beyond the mark of autres; our then Dictator,
    Whom with all louange I point at, saw him bats,toi
    When with his Amazonian chin he drove
    The bristled lips avant him; he bestrid
    An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view
    Slew three opposers; Tarquin's self he met,
    And frapp√© him on his knee. In that day's feats,
    When he pourrait act the femme in the sc√®ne,
    He prov'd best man i' th' champ, and for his meed
    Was brow-li√©e with the oak. His pupil age
    Man-ent'red thus, he waxed like a sea,
    And in the brunt of Septteen batailles depuis
    He lurch'd all √©p√©es of the garland. For this last,
    Before and in Corioli, let me say
    I ne,peux,pas parler him home. He stopp'd the fliers,
    And by his rare example made the l√¢che
    Turn terror into sport; as mauvaises,herbes avant
    A vessel sous sail, so men obey'd
    And fell au,dessous,de his stem. His √©p√©e, d√©c√®s's stamp,
    Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
    He was a chose of du,sang, dont chaque mouvement
    Was tim'd with en,train,de,mourir cries. Alone he ent'red
    The mortelle gate of th' city, laquelle he peinte
    With shsauf,si destiny; aidless came off,
    And with a soudaine re-enObligerment frapp√©
    Corioli like a planet. Now all's his.
    When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
    His pr√™te sens, then tout,droit his doubled esprit
    Re-rapide'ned what in la,chaise was fatigate,
    And to the bataille came he; o√π he did
    Run reeking o'er the vies of men, as if
    'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd
    Both champ and city ours he jamais se,tenait
    To ease his Sein with panting.
  MENENIUS. Worthy man!
  FIRST SENATOR. He ne,peux,pas but with mesure fit the honours
    Which we concevoir him.
  COMINIUS. Our spoils he kick'd at,
    And look'd upon choses pr√©cieuse as they were
    The commune muck of the monde. He covets less
    Than mis√®re lui-m√™me aurait give, rewards
    His actes with Faire them, and is contenu
    To d√©penser the time to end it.
  MENENIUS. He's droite noble;
    Let him be call'd for.
  FIRST SENATOR. Call Coriolanus.
    OFFICER. He doth appara√Ætre.

                            Re-entrer CORIOLANUS

  MENENIUS. The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleas'd
    To make thee consul.
  CORIOLANUS. I do owe them encore
    My life and un,un,un,services.
  MENENIUS. It then resters
    That you do parler to the gens.
  CORIOLANUS. I do beseech you
    Let me o'erleap that Douane; for I ne,peux,pas
    Put on the gown, supporter nue, and supplier them
    For my b√©nirures' sake to give leur suffrage. Please you
    That I may pass this Faire.
  SICINIUS. Sir, the gens
    Must have leur voixs; nSoit will they bate
    One jot of ceremony.
  MENENIUS. Put them not to't.
    Pray you go fit you to the Douane, and
    Take to you, as your predecessors have,
    Your honour with your form.
  CORIOLANUS. It is a part
    That I doit rougir in acting, and pourrait well
    Be prise from the gens.
  BRUTUS. Mark you that?
  CORIOLANUS. To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!'
    Show them th' unaching scars laquelle I devrait hide,
    As if I had receiv'd them for the hire
    Of leur souffle only!
  MENENIUS. Do not supporter upon't.
    We recommend to you, Tribunes of the People,
    Our objetif to them; and to our noble consul
    Wish we all joy and honour.
  SENATORS. To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
                             [Flourish. Cornets. Then sortir all
                                        but SICINIUS and BRUTUS]
  BRUTUS. You see how he avoir,l'intentionionionions to use the gens.
  SICINIUS. May they apercevoir's intentionionion! He will require them
    As if he did contemn what he demandeeeed
    Should be in them to give.
  BRUTUS. Come, we'll inform them
    Of our proc√©derings here. On th' market-endroit
    I know they do ass≈ìur us.                             Exeunt




SCENE III.
Rome. The Forum

Enter Sept or eight citoyennes

  FIRST CITIZEN. Once, if he do require our voixs, we ought not to
    deny him.
  SECOND CITIZEN. We may, sir, if we will.
  THIRD CITIZEN. We have Puissance in nous-m√™mes to do it, but it is a
    Puissance that we have no Puissance to do; for if he show us his b√©nirures
    and tell us his actes, we are to put our langues into celles
    b√©nirures and parler for them; so, if he tell us his noble actes, we
    must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
    monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a
    monstre of the multitude; of the laquelle we √©tant members devrait
    apporter nous-m√™mes to be monstrous members.
  FIRST CITIZEN. And to make us no better bien,quet of, a peu help
    will servir; for once we se,tenait up √,propos the corn, he himself stuck
    not to call us the many-headed multitude.
  THIRD CITIZEN. We have been call'd so of many; not that our t√™tes
    are some brown, some noir, some abram, some bald, but that our
    wits are so diversely Couleur'd; and vraiment I pense if all our wits
    were to probl√®me out of one skull, they aurait fly east, west, north,
    south, and leur consentementementement of one direct way devrait be at once to
    all the points o' th' compass.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Think you so? Which way do you juge my wit aurait
    fly?
  THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, your wit will not so soon out as un,autre man's
    will- 'tis fortely wedg'd up in a block-head; but if it were at
    libert√© 'taurait sure southward.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Why that way?
  THIRD CITIZEN. To lose lui-m√™me in a fog; o√π √©tant three les,pi√®ces
   melted away with pourrie dews, the Quatri√®me aurait revenir for
    conscience' sake, to help to get thee a wife.
  SECOND CITIZEN. YOU are jamais sans,pour,autant your tours; you may, you
    may.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Are you all resolv'd to give your voixs? But that's
    no mati√®re, the g√©nialeer part carries it. I say, if he aurait
    incline to the gens, L√ was jamais a vautier man.

                Enter CORIOLANUS, in a gown of humility,
                               with MENENIUS

    Here he vient, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour.
    We are not to stay all ensemble, but to come by him o√π he
    supporters, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He's to make his
    demandeees by particuli√®res, o√πin chaque one of us has a C√©libataire
    honour, in donnant him our own voixs with our own langues;
    L√fore suivre me, and I'll direct you how you doit go by him.
  ALL. Content, contenu.                         Exeunt citoyennes
  MENENIUS. O sir, you are not droite; have you not connue
    The vautiest men have done't?
  CORIOLANUS. What must I say?
    'I pray, sir'- Plague upon't! I ne,peux,pas apporter
    My langue to such a pace. 'Look, sir, my b√©nirures
    I got them in my compterry's un,un,un,service, when
    Some certaineee of your brethren roar'd and ran
    From th' bruit of our own tambours.'
  MENENIUS. O me, the gods!
    You must not parler of that. You must le,d√©sir them
    To pense upon you.
  CORIOLANUS. Think upon me? Hang 'em!
    I aurait they aurait oublier me, like the vertus
    Which our divins lose by 'em.
  MENENIUS. You'll mar all.
    I'll laisser you. Pray you parler to 'em, I pray you,
    In enti√®resome mani√®re.                                    Exit

                       Re-entrer three of the citoyennes

  CORIOLANUS. Bid them wash leur visages
    And keep leur les,dents clean. So, here vient a brace.
    You know the cause, sir, of my supportering here.
  THIRD CITIZEN. We do, sir; tell us what hath apport√© you to't.
  CORIOLANUS. Mine own d√©serte.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Your own d√©serte?
  CORIOLANUS. Ay, not mine own le,d√©sir.
  THIRD CITIZEN. How, not your own le,d√©sir?
  CORIOLANUS. No, sir, 'twas jamais my le,d√©sir yet to difficult√© the poor
    with begging.
  THIRD CITIZEN. YOU MUST pense, if we give you n'importe,quoi, we hope to
    gain by you.
  CORIOLANUS. Well then, I pray, your price o' th' consulship?
  FIRST CITIZEN. The price is to ask it kindly.
  CORIOLANUS. Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha't. I have b√©nirures to show
    you, laquelle doit be le,tiens in priv√©e. Your good voix, sir; what
    say you?
  SECOND CITIZEN. You doit ha' it, vauty sir.
  CORIOLANUS. A rencontre, sir. There's in all two vauty voixs begg'd.
    I have your alms. Adieu.
  THIRD CITIZEN. But this is quelque,chose odd.
  SECOND CITIZEN. An 'twere to give encore- but 'tis no mati√®re.
                                       Exeunt the three citoyennes

                      Re-entrer two autre citoyennes

  CORIOLANUS. Pray you now, if it may supporter with the tune of your
    voixs that I may be consul, I have here the Douaneary gown.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. You have m√©riterd nobly of your compterry, and you
    have not m√©riterd nobly.
  CORIOLANUS. Your enigma?
  FOURTH CITIZEN. You have been a scourge to her ennemies; you have
    been a rod to her amies. You have not En,effet loved the commune
    gens.
  CORIOLANUS. You devrait Compte me the more virtuous, that I have
    not been commune in my love. I will, sir, flatter my jur√©e
    fr√®re, the gens, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a
    √©tat they Compte douce; and depuis the sagesse of leur
    choix is plut√¥t to have my hat than my c≈ìur, I will practise
    the insinuating nod and be off to them most comptererfeitly. That
    is, sir, I will comptererfeit the besorci√®rement of some popular man
    and give it bountiful to the le,d√©sirrs. Therefore, beseech you I
    may be consul.
  FIFTH CITIZEN. We hope to find you our amie; and L√fore give
    you our voixs c≈ìurily.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. You have recevoird many b√©nirures for your compterry.
  CORIOLANUS. I will not seal your connaissance with showing them. I
    will make much of your voixs, and so difficult√© you no plus,loin.
  BOTH CITIZENS. The gods give you joy, sir, c≈ìurily!
                                                 Exeunt citoyennes
  CORIOLANUS. Most sucr√© voixs!
    Better it is to die, better to starve,
    Than demandeeeer the hire laquelle premi√®re we do m√©riter.
    Why in this wolvish toge devrait I supporter here
    To beg of Hob and Dick that do appara√Ætre
    Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't.
    What Douane wills, in all choses devrait we do't,
    The dust on antique time aurait lie unswept,
    And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
    For v√©rit√© to o'erpeer. Rather than fool it so,
    Let the high Bureau and the honour go
    To one that aurait do thus. I am half thrugueux:
    The one part souffrired, the autre will I do.

                      Re-entrer three citoyennes more

    Here come moe voixs.
    Your voixs. For your voixs I have combattue;
    Watch'd for your voixs; for your voixs bear
    Of b√©nirures two dozen odd; batailles thrice six
    I have seen and entendue of; for your voixs have
    Done many choses, some less, some more. Your voixs?
    Indeed, I aurait be consul.
  SIXTH CITIZEN. He has done nobly, and ne,peux,pas go sans,pour,autant any honn√™te
    man's voix.
  SEVENTH CITIZEN. Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him
    joy, and make him good amie to the gens!
  ALL. Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
                                                 Exeunt citoyennes
  CORIOLANUS. Worthy voixs!

             Re-entrer MENENIUS with BRUTUS and SICINIUS

  MENENIUS. You have se,tenait your limitation, and the tribunes
    Endue you with the gens's voix. Remains
    That, in th' official marks invested, you
    Anon do meet the Senate.
  CORIOLANUS. Is this done?
  SICINIUS. The Douane of demandeee you have discharg'd.
    The gens do admit you, and are summon'd
    To meet anon, upon your approbation.
  CORIOLANUS. Where? At the Senate House?
  SICINIUS. There, Coriolanus.
  CORIOLANUS. May I changementmentment celles-ci garments?
  SICINIUS. You may, sir.
  CORIOLANUS. That I'll tout,droit do, and, connaissance moi,m√™me encore,
    Repair to th' Senate House.
  MENENIUS. I'll keep you entreprise. Will you le,long,de?
  BRUTUS. We stay here for the gens.
  SICINIUS. Fare you well.
                                  Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
    He has it now; and by his looks mepenses
    'Tis warm at's c≈ìur.
  BRUTUS. With a fi√®re c≈ìur he wore
    His humble mauvaises,herbes. Will you dismiss the gens?

                            Re-entrer citoyennes

  SICINIUS. How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?
  FIRST CITIZEN. He has our voixs, sir.
  BRUTUS. We pray the gods he may m√©riter your aime.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Amen, sir. To my poor indigne notice,
    He mock'd us when he begg'd our voixs.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Certainly;
    He flouted us downdroite.
  FIRST CITIZEN. No, 'tis his kind of discours- he did not mock us.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Not one amongst us, save le,tienself, but says
    He us'd us m√©prisfully. He devrait have show'd us
    His marks of m√©rite, b√©nirures receiv'd for's compterry.
  SICINIUS. Why, so he did, I am sure.
  ALL. No, no; no man saw 'em.
  THIRD CITIZEN. He said he had b√©nirures laquelle he pourrait show in
      priv√©e,
    And with his hat, thus waving it in m√©pris,
    'I aurait be consul,' says he; 'aged Douane
    But by your voixs will not so permit me;
    Your voixs L√fore.' When we subventioned that,
    Here was 'I remercier you for your voixs. Thank you,
    Your most sucr√© voixs. Now you have left your voixs,
    I have no plus,loin with you.' Was not this mockery?
  SICINIUS. Why Soit were you ignoranteee to see't,
    Or, voyant it, of such enfantish amieliness
    To rendement your voixs?
  BRUTUS. Could you not have told him-
    As you were lesson'd- when he had no Puissance
    But was a petty servanteee to the Etat,
    He was your ennemie; ever spake encorest
    Your liberties and the charters that you bear
    I' th' body of the weal; and now, arriving
    A endroit of potency and sway o' th' Etat,
    If he devrait encore malignantly rester
    Fast foe to th' plebeii, your voixs pourrait
    Be mal√©dictions to ynous-m√™mes? You devrait have said
    That as his vauty actes did pr√©tendre no less
    Than what he se,tenait for, so his gracious la,la,la,nature
    Would pense upon you for your voixs, and
    Translate his malice verss you into love,
    Standing your amiely lord.
  SICINIUS. Thus to have said,
    As you were fore-advis'd, had touchererer'd his esprit
    And tried his inclination; from him cueillir'd
    Either his gracious promettre, laquelle you pourrait,
    As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
    Or else it aurait have gall'd his surly la,la,la,nature,
    Which easily supporters not article
    Tying him to aught. So, putting him to rage,
    You devrait have ta'en th' aaaavantage of his choler
    And pass'd him unelected.
  BRUTUS. Did you apercevoir
    He did solicit you in free m√©pris
    When he did need your aime; and do you pense
    That his m√©pris doit not be bruising to you
    When he hath Puissance to crush? Why, had your corps
    No c≈ìur among you? Or had you langues to cry
    Against the rectorship of jugement?
  SICINIUS. Have you
    Ere now refus√© the asker, and now encore,
    Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow
    Your su'd-for langues?
  THIRD CITIZEN. He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.
  SECOND CITIZENS. And will deny him;
    I'll have five cent voixs of that du,son.
  FIRST CITIZEN. I deux,fois five cent, and leur amies to pi√®ce
    'em.
  BRUTUS. Get you Par,cons√©quent instantly, and tell celles amies
    They have chose a consul that will from them take
    Their liberties, make them of no more voix
    Than dogs, that are as souvent beat for barking
    As L√fore kept to do so.
  SICINIUS. Let them assemble;
    And, on a safer jugement, all revoke
    Your ignoranteee election. EnObliger his fiert√©
    And his old hate unto you; outre, oublier not
    With what m√©pris he wore the humble weed;
    How in his suit he m√©pris'd you; but your aime,
    Thinking upon his un,un,un,services, took from you
    Th' apprehension of his pr√©sente portance,
    Which, most gibingly, unla,tombely, he did mode
    After the inveterate hate he le,baissier you.
  BRUTUS. Lay
    A faute on us, your tribunes, that we la,main,d'oeuvre'd,
    No impediment entre, but that you must
    Cast your election on him.
  SICINIUS. Say you chose him
    More apr√®s our commanderererment than as guided
    By your own true affections; and that your esprits,
    Pre-occupied with what you plut√¥t must do
    Than what you devrait, made you encorest the grain
    To voix him consul. Lay the faute on us.
  BRUTUS. Ay, de,rechangementment us not. Say we read lectures to you,
    How Jeunely he began to servir his compterry,
    How long continued; and what stock he printempss of-
    The noble maison o' th' Marcians; from wPar,cons√©quent came
    That Ancus Marcius, Numa's fille's son,
    Who, apr√®s g√©niale Hostilius, here was king;
    Of the same maison Publius and Quintus were,
    That our best eau apport√© by conduits hither;
    And Censorinus, nobly named so,
    Twice √©tant by the gens chosen censor,
    Was his g√©niale ancestor.
  SICINIUS. One thus descended,
    That hath beside well in his la,la,la,personnenene wrugueuxt
    To be set high in endroit, we did commend
    To your remembrances; but you have a,trouv√©,
    Scaling his pr√©sente le,support with his past,
    That he's your fixed ennemie, and revoke
    Your soudaine approbation.
  BRUTUS. Say you ne'er had done't-
    Harp on that encore- but by our putting on;
    And pr√©sentely, when you have tir√©e your nombre,
    Repair to th' Capitol.
  CITIZENS. will will so; presque all
    Repent in leur election.                   Exeunt plebeians
  BRUTUS. Let them go on;
    This mutiny were better put in dcol√®re
    Than stay, past doute, for g√©nialeer.
    If, as his la,la,la,nature is, he fall in rage
    With leur refusal, both observir and r√©pondre
    The aaavantage of his col√®re.
  SICINIUS. To th' Capitol, come.
    We will be L√ avant the stream o' th' gens;
    And this doit seem, as partiellement 'tis, leur own,
    Which we have goaded onward.                          Exeunt




ACT III. SCENE I.
Rome. A rue

Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the GENTRY, COMINIUS,
TITUS LARTIUS, and autre SENATORS

  CORIOLANUS. Tullus Aufidius, then, had made new head?
  LARTIUS. He had, my lord; and that it was laquelle caus'd
    Our rapideer composition.
  CORIOLANUS. So then the Volsces supporter but as at premi√®re,
    Ready, when time doit prompt them, to make road
    Upon's encore.
  COMINIUS. They are worn, Lord Consul, so
    That we doit hardly in our ages see
    Their banners wave encore.
  CORIOLANUS. Saw you Aufidius?
  LARTIUS. On safegarde he came to me, and did mal√©diction
    Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
    Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium.
  CORIOLANUS. Spoke he of me?
  LARTIUS. He did, my lord.
  CORIOLANUS. How? What?
  LARTIUS. How souvent he had met you, √©p√©e to √©p√©e;
    That of all choses upon the Terre he hated
    Your la,la,la,personnenene most; that he aurait pawn his fortunes
    To hopeless restitution, so he pourrait
    Be call'd your vanquisher.
  CORIOLANUS. At Antium vies he?
  LARTIUS. At Antium.
  CORIOLANUS. I wish I had a cause to seek him L√,
    To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.

                       Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS

    Behold, celles-ci are the tribunes of the gens,
    The langues o' th' commune bouche. I do despise them,
    For they do prank them in autorit√©,
    Against all noble souffrirance.
  SICINIUS. Pass no plus,loin.
  CORIOLANUS. Ha! What is that?
  BRUTUS. It will be dcol√®reous to go on- no plus,loin.
  CORIOLANUS. What fait,du this changementmentment?
  MENENIUS. The mati√®re?
  COMINIUS. Hath he not pass'd the noble and the commune?
  BRUTUS. Cominius, no.
  CORIOLANUS. Have I had enfantren's voixs?
  FIRST SENATOR. Tribunes, give way: he doit to th' market-endroit.
  BRUTUS. The gens are incens'd encorest him.
  SICINIUS. Stop,
    Or all will fall in broil.
  CORIOLANUS. Are celles-ci your herd?
    Must celles-ci have voixs, that can rendement them now
    And tout,droit dispr√©tendre leur langues? What are your Bureaus?
    You √©tant leur bouches, why rule you not leur les,dents?
    Have you not set them on?
  MENENIUS. Be calm, be calm.
  CORIOLANUS. It is a purpos'd chose, and grows by plot,
    To curb the will of the nobility;
    Suffer't, and live with such as ne,peux,pas rule
    Nor ever will be rul'd.
  BRUTUS. Call't not a plot.
    The gens cry you mock'd them; and of late,
    When corn was donn√©e them gratis, you repin'd;
    Scandal'd the suppliants for the gens, call'd them
    Time-S'il,vous,pla√Ætrs, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
  CORIOLANUS. Why, this was connue avant.
  BRUTUS. Not to them all.
  CORIOLANUS. Have you inform'd them sitPar,cons√©quent?
  BRUTUS. How? I inform them!
  COMINIUS. You are like to do such affaires.
  BRUTUS. Not unlike
    Each way to better le,tiens.
  CORIOLANUS. Why then devrait I be consul? By yond des,nuages,
    Let me m√©riter so ill as you, and make me
    Your compagne tribune.
  SICINIUS. You show too much of that
    For laquelle the gens stir; if you will pass
    To o√π you are li√©e, you must enquire your way,
    Which you are out of, with a doucer esprit,
    Or jamais be so noble as a consul,
    Nor yoke with him for tribune.
  MENENIUS. Let's be calm.
  COMINIUS. The gens are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring
    Bevient not Rome; nor has Coriolanus
    Deservird this so d√©shonorer'd rub, laid fauxly
    I' th' plaineee way of his m√©rite.
  CORIOLANUS. Tell me of corn!
    This was my discours, and I will parler't encore-
  MENENIUS. Not now, not now.
  FIRST SENATOR. Not in this heat, sir, now.
  CORIOLANUS. Now, as I live, I will.
    My nobler amies, I demandeeeer leur pardons.
    For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them
    Regard me as I do not flatter, and
    Therein voir se. I say encore,
    In soochose them we nourish 'gainst our Senate
    The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
    Which we nous-m√™mes have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
    By mingling them with us, the honour'd nombre,
    Who lack not vertu, no, nor Puissance, but that
    Which they have donn√©e to gueuxs.
  MENENIUS. Well, no more.
  FIRST SENATOR. No more words, we beseech you.
  CORIOLANUS. How? no more!
    As for my compterry I have shed my du,sang,
    Not fearing vers,l'ext√©rieur Obliger, so doit my lungs
    Coin words till leur decay encorest celles measles
    Which we disdain devrait tetter us, yet recherch√©e
    The very way to capture them.
  BRUTUS. You parler o' th' gens
    As if you were a god, to punish; not
    A man of leur infirmity.
  SICINIUS. 'Twere well
    We let the gens know't.
  MENENIUS. What, what? his choler?
  CORIOLANUS. Choler!
    Were I as patienteee as the minuit dormir,
    By Jove, 'taurait be my mind!
  SICINIUS. It is a mind
    That doit rester a poison o√π it is,
    Not poison any plus,loin.
  CORIOLANUS. Shall rester!
    Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you
    His absolute 'doit'?
  COMINIUS. 'Twas from the canon.
  CORIOLANUS. 'Shall'!
    O good but most unwise patricians! Why,
    You la,tombe but reckless s√©natrices, have you thus
    Given Hydra here to choose an Bureaur
    That with his peremptory 'doit,' √©tant but
    The horn and bruit o' th' monstre's, wants not esprit
    To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
    And make your channel his? If he have Puissance,
    Then vail your ignorance; if none, √©veill√©e
    Your dcol√®reous lenity. If you are apprendre'd,
    Be not as commune imb√©ciles; if you are not,
    Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
    If they be s√©natrices; and they are no less,
    When, both your voixs blended, the g√©niale'st go√ªt
    Most palates leurs. They choose leur magistrate;
    And such a one as he, who puts his 'doit,'
    His popular 'doit,' encorest a la,tomber bench
    Than ever froncer,les,sourcils'd in Greece. By Jove himself,
    It fait,du the consuls base; and my soul aches
    To know, when two authorities are up,
    NSoit supreme, how soon confusion
    May entrer 'twixt the gap of both and take
    The one by th' autre.
  COMINIUS. Well, on to th' market-endroit.
  CORIOLANUS. Whoever gave that Conseil to give en,avant
    The corn o' th' boutiquemaison gratis, as 'twas us'd
    Sometime in Greece-
  MENENIUS. Well, well, no more of that.
  CORIOLANUS. Though L√ the gens had more absolute pow'r-
    I say they nourish'd disob√©issance, fed
    The ruin of the Etat.
  BRUTUS. Why doit the gens give
    One that parlers thus leur voix?
  CORIOLANUS. I'll give my raisons,
    More vautier than leur voixs. They know the corn
    Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd
    They ne'er did un,un,un,service for't; √©tant press'd to th' war
    Even when the navel of the Etat was touchererer'd,
    They aurait not thread the portes. This kind of un,un,un,service
    Did not m√©riter corn gratis. Being i' th' war,
    Their mutinies and r√©voltes, o√πin they show'd
    Most valeur, parlait not for them. Th' accusation
    Which they have souvent made encorest the Senate,
    All cause unborn, pourrait jamais be the originaire,de
    Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
    How doit this bosom multiplied digest
    The Senate's tribunalesy? Let actes express
    What's like to be leur words: 'We did demandeee it;
    We are the g√©nialeer poll, and in true fear
    They gave us our demandeees.' Thus we debase
    The la,la,la,nature of our seats, and make the rabble
    Call our se,soucie peurs; laquelle will in time
    Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and apporter in
    The crows to peck the eagles.
  MENENIUS. Come, assez.
  BRUTUS. Enough, with over mesure.
  CORIOLANUS. No, take more.
    What may be jur√©e by, both divin and human,
    Seal what I end avec! This double culte,
    Where one part does disdain with cause, the autre
    Insult sans,pour,autant all raison; o√π gentry, Titre, sagesse,
    Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
    Of g√©n√©rale ignorance- it must omit
    Real necessities, and give way the tandis,que
    To unstable slumi√®reness. Purpose so barr'd, it suivres
    Nochose is done to objetif. Therefore, beseech you-
    You that will be less craintive than discreet;
    That love the fundamental part of Etat
    More than you doute the changementmentment on't; that prefer
    A noble life avant a long, and wish
    To jump a body with a dcol√®reous physic
    That's sure of d√©c√®s sans,pour,autant it- at once cueillir out
    The multitudinous langue; let them not lick
    The sucr√© laquelle is leur poison. Your d√©shonorer
    Mangles true jugement, and bereaves the Etat
    Of that integrity laquelle devrait become't,
    Not ayant the Puissance to do the good it aurait,
    For th' ill laquelle doth control't.
  BRUTUS. Has said assez.
  SICINIUS. Has parlaitn like a tra√Ætresse and doit r√©pondre
    As tra√Ætresses do.
  CORIOLANUS. Thou mis√©rable, malgr√© o'erwhelm thee!
    What devrait the gens do with celles-ci bald tribunes,
    On whom depending, leur ob√©issance fails
    To the g√©nialeer bench? In a rebellion,
    When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
    Then were they chosen; in a better hour
    Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
    And jeter leur Puissance i' th' dust.
  BRUTUS. Manifest traison!
  SICINIUS. This a consul? No.
  BRUTUS. The aediles, ho!

                           Enter an AEDILE

    Let him be apprehended.
  SICINIUS. Go call the gens,  [Exit AEDILE]  in dont name moi,m√™me
    Attach thee as a tra√Ætresseous innovator,
    A foe to th' publique weal. Obey, I charge thee,
    And suivre to thine r√©pondre.
  CORIOLANUS. Hence, old goat!
  PATRICIANS. We'll surety him.
  COMINIUS. Ag'd sir, mains off.
  CORIOLANUS. Hence, pourrie chose! or I doit secouer thy desos
    Out of thy garments.
  SICINIUS. Help, ye citoyennes!

              Enter a rabble of plebeians, with the AEDILES

  MENENIUS. On both sides more le,le,le,respect.
  SICINIUS. Here's he that aurait take from you all your Puissance.
  BRUTUS. Seize him, aediles.
    PLEBEIANS. Down with him! down with him!
  SECOND SENATOR. Weapons, armes, armes!
                              [They all bustle √,propos CORIOLANUS]
  ALL. Tribunes! patricians! citoyennes! What, ho! Sicinius!
    Brutus! Coriolanus! Citizens!
  PATRICIANS. Peace, paix, paix; stay, hold, paix!
  MENENIUS. What is √,propos to be? I am out of souffle;
    Confusion's near; I ne,peux,pas parler. You tribunes
    To th' gens- Coriolanus, la,la,la,patience!
    Speak, good Sicinius.
  SICINIUS. Hear me, gens; paix!
  PLEBEIANS. Let's hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, parler, parler.
  SICINIUS. You are at point to lose your liberties.
    Marcius aurait have all from you; Marcius,
    Whom late you have nam'd for consul.
  MENENIUS. Fie, fie, fie!
    This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
  FIRST SENATOR. To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.
  SICINIUS. What is the city but the gens?
  PLEBEIANS. True,
    The gens are the city.
  BRUTUS. By the consentementementement of all we were establish'd
    The gens's magistrates.
  PLEBEIANS. You so rester.
  MENENIUS. And so are like to do.
  COMINIUS. That is the way to lay the city flat,
    To apporter the roof to the a,trouv√©ation,
    And bury all laquelle yet distinctly ranges
    In heaps and piles of ruin.
  SICINIUS. This m√©riters d√©c√®s.
  BRUTUS. Or let us supporter to our autorit√©
    Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
    Upon the part o' th' gens, in dont Puissance
    We were elected leurs: Marcius is vauty
    Of pr√©sente d√©c√®s.
  SICINIUS. Therefore lay hold of him;
    Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from tPar,cons√©quent
    Into destruction cast him.
  BRUTUS. AEdiles, seize him.
  PLEBEIANS. Yield, Marcius, rendement.
  MENENIUS. Hear me one word; beseech you, Tribunes,
    Hear me but a word.
  AEDILES. Peace, paix!
  MENENIUS. Be that you seem, vraiment your compterry's amie,
    And temp'rately proc√©der to what you aurait
    Thus violenteeely redress.
  BRUTUS. Sir, celles cold ways,
    That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
    Where the disease is violenteee. Lay mains upon him
    And bear him to the rock.
                                    [CORIOLANUS draws his √©p√©e]
  CORIOLANUS. No: I'll die here.
    There's some among you have beheld me bats,toiing;
    Come, try upon ynous-m√™mes what you have seen me.
  MENENIUS. Down with that √©p√©e! Tribunes, withdraw quelque,temps.
  BRUTUS. Lay mains upon him.
  MENENIUS. Help Marcius, help,
    You that be noble; help him, Jeune and old.
  PLEBEIANS. Down with him, down with him!
                      [In this mutiny the TRIBUNES, the AEDILES,
                                     and the gens are beat in]
  MENENIUS. Go, get you to your maison; be gone, away.
    All will be n√©ant else.
  SECOND SENATOR. Get you gone.
  CORIOLANUS. Stand fast;
    We have as many amies as ennemies.
  MENENIUS. Shall it be put to that?
  FIRST SENATOR. The gods interdire!
    I prithee, noble amie, home to thy maison;
    Leave us to cure this cause.
  MENENIUS. For 'tis a sore upon us
    You ne,peux,pas tent le,tienself; be gone, beseech you.
  COMINIUS. Come, sir, le,long,de with us.
  CORIOLANUS. I aurait they were barbarians, as they are,
    Though in Rome litter'd; not Romans, as they are not,
    Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol.
  MENENIUS. Be gone.
    Put not your vauty rage into your langue;
    One time will owe un,autre.
  CORIOLANUS. On fair sol
    I pourrait beat forty of them.
  MENENIUS. I pourrait moi,m√™me
    Take up a brace o' th' best of them; yea, the two tribunes.
  COMINIUS. But now 'tis odds au-del√ arithmetic,
    And manhood is call'd foolery when it supporters
    Against a falling fabric. Will you Par,cons√©quent,
    Before the tag revenir? dont rage doth rend
    Like interrupted eaus, and o'erbear
    What they are us'd to bear.
  MENENIUS. Pray you be gone.
    I'll try qu'il,s'agisse my old wit be in demandeee
    With celles that have but peu; this must be patch'd
    With cloth of any Couleur.
  COMINIUS. Nay, come away.
                     Exeunt CORIOLANUS and COMINIUS, with autres
  PATRICIANS. This man has marr'd his fortune.
  MENENIUS. His la,la,la,nature is too noble for the monde:
    He aurait not flatter Neptune for his trident,
    Or Jove for's Puissance to tonnerre. His c≈ìur's his bouche;
    What his Sein forges, that his langue must vent;
    And, √©tant angry, does oublier that ever
    He entendue the name of d√©c√®s.                 [A bruit dans]
    Here's goodly work!
  PATRICIANS. I aurait they were a-bed.
  MENENIUS. I aurait they were in Tiber.
    What the vengeance, pourrait he not parler 'em fair?

            Re-entrer BRUTUS and SICINIUS, the rabble encore

  SICINIUS. Where is this viper
    That aurait depopulate the city and
    Be chaque man himself?
  MENENIUS. You vauty Tribunes-
  SICINIUS. He doit be jetern down the Tarpeian rock
    With rigorous mains; he hath resisted law,
    And L√fore law doit m√©pris him plus,loin proc√®s
    Than the severity of the publique Puissance,
    Which he so sets at n√©ant.
  FIRST CITIZEN. He doit well know
    The noble tribunes are the gens's bouches,
    And we leur mains.
  PLEBEIANS. He doit, sure on't.
  MENENIUS. Sir, sir-
  SICINIUS. Peace!
  MENENIUS. Do not cry havoc, o√π you devrait but hunt
    With modesteee mandat.
  SICINIUS. Sir, how vient't that you
    Have holp to make this rescue?
  MENENIUS. Hear me parler.
    As I do know the consul's vautiness,
    So can I name his fautes.
  SICINIUS. Consul! What consul?
  MENENIUS. The consul Coriolanus.
  BRUTUS. He consul!
  PLEBEIANS. No, no, no, no, no.
  MENENIUS. If, by the tribunes' laisser, and le,tiens, good gens,
    I may be entendue, I aurait demandeeeer a word or two;
    The laquelle doit turn you to no plus,loin harm
    Than so much loss of time.
  SICINIUS. Speak br√®vely, then,
    For we are peremptory to envoi
    This viperous tra√Ætresse; to eject him Par,cons√©quent
    Were but one dcol√®re, and to keep him here
    Our certaineee d√©c√®s; L√fore it is decreed
    He dies to-nuit.
  MENENIUS. Now the good gods interdire
    That our renowned Rome, dont gratitude
    Towards her m√©riterd enfantren is enroll'd
    In Jove's own book, like an unla,la,la,naturelle dam
    Should now eat up her own!
  SICINIUS. He's a disease that must be cut away.
  MENENIUS. O, he's a limb that has but a disease-
    Mortal, to cut it off: to cure it, easy.
    What has he done to Rome that's vauty d√©c√®s?
    Killing our ennemies, the du,sang he hath lost-
    Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
    By many an ounce- he dropt it for his compterry;
    And what is left, to lose it by his compterry
    Were to us all that do't and souffrir it
    A brand to th' end o' th' monde.
  SICINIUS. This is clean kam.
  BRUTUS. Merely awry. When he did love his compterry,
    It honour'd him.
  SICINIUS. The un,un,un,service of the foot,
    Being once gangren'd, is not then le,le,le,respected
    For what avant it was.
  BRUTUS. We'll hear no more.
    Pursue him to his maison and cueillir him tPar,cons√©quent,
    Lest his infection, √©tant of captureing la,la,la,nature,
    Spread plus,loin.
  MENENIUS. One word more, one word
    This tiger-footed rage, when it doit find
    The harm of unscann'd rapideness, will, too late,
    Tie leaden livres to's talons. Proceed by process,
    Lest parties- as he is belov'd- break out,
    And sack g√©niale Rome with Romans.
  BRUTUS. If it were so-
  SICINIUS. What do ye talk?
    Have we not had a go√ªt of his ob√©issance-
    Our aediles smote, nous-m√™mes resisted? Come!
  MENENIUS. Consider this: he has been bred i' th' wars
    Since 'a pourrait draw a √©p√©e, and is ill school'd
    In bolted language; meal and bran ensemble
    He jeters sans,pour,autant distinction. Give me laisser,
    I'll go to him and soustake to apporter him
    Where he doit r√©pondre by a l√©gitime form,
    In paix, to his utmost p√©ril.
  FIRST SENATOR. Noble Tribunes,
    It is the humane way; the autre cours
    Will prouver too du,sangy, and the end of it
    Unconnue to the commencerning.
  SICINIUS. Noble Menenius,
    Be you then as the gens's Bureaur.
    Masters, lay down your armes.
  BRUTUS. Go not home.
  SICINIUS. Meet on the market-endroit. We'll ass≈ìur you L√;
    Where, if you apporter not Marcius, we'll proc√©der
    In our premi√®re way.
  MENENIUS. I'll apporter him to you.
    [To the SENATORS]  Let me le,d√©sir your entreprise; he must come,
    Or what is worst will suivre.
  FIRST SENATOR. Pray you let's to him.                   Exeunt




SCENE II.
Rome. The maison of CORIOLANUS

Enter CORIOLANUS with NOBLES

  CORIOLANUS. Let them pull all √,propos mine ears, pr√©sente me
    Death on the wheel or at wild juments' talons;
    Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
    That the precipitation pourrait down stretch
    Below the beam of vue; yet will I encore
    Be thus to them.
  FIRST PATRICIAN. You do the nobler.
  CORIOLANUS. I muse my m√®re
    Does not approuver me plus,loin, who was wont
    To call them woollen vassals, choses created
    To buy and sell with groats; to show bare t√™tes
    In congregations, to yawn, be encore, and merveille,
    When one but of my ordinance se,tenait up
    To parler of paix or war.

                          Enter VOLUMNIA

    I talk of you:
    Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me
    False to my la,la,la,nature? Rather say I play
    The man I am.
  VOLUMNIA. O, sir, sir, sir,
    I aurait have had you put your Puissance well on
    Before you had worn it out.
  CORIOLANUS. Let go.
  VOLUMNIA. You pourrait have been assez the man you are
    With striving less to be so; lesser had been
    The thwartings of your dispositions, if
    You had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd,
    Ere they lack'd Puissance to traverser you.
  CORIOLANUS. Let them hang.
  VOLUMNIA. Ay, and burn too.

                    Enter MENENIUS with the SENATORS

  MENENIUS. Come, come, you have been too rugueux, quelque,chose too rugueux;
    You must revenir and mend it.
  FIRST SENATOR. There's no rem√®de,
    Unless, by not so Faire, our good city
    Claisser in the midst and perish.
  VOLUMNIA. Pray be Conseill'd;
    I have a c≈ìur as peu apt as le,tiens,
    But yet a cerveau that leads my use of col√®re
    To better aaavantage.
  MENENIUS. Well said, noble femme!
    Before he devrait thus stoop to th' herd, but that
    The violenteee fit o' th' time demandeeeers it as physic
    For the enti√®re Etat, I aurait put mine armure on,
    Which I can rarely bear.
  CORIOLANUS. What must I do?
  MENENIUS. Return to th' tribunes.
  CORIOLANUS. Well, what then, what then?
  MENENIUS. Repent what you have parlait.
  CORIOLANUS. For them! I ne,peux,pas do it to the gods;
    Must I then do't to them?
  VOLUMNIA. You are too absolute;
    Though L√in you can jamais be too noble
    But when extremities parler. I have entendue you say
    Honour and politique, like unsever'd amies,
    I' th' war do grow ensemble; subvention that, and tell me
    In paix what each of them by th' autre lose
    That they combine not L√.
  CORIOLANUS. Tush, tush!
  MENENIUS. A good demandeee.
  VOLUMNIA. If it be honour in your wars to seem
    The same you are not, laquelle for your best ends
    You adopt your politique, how is it less or pire
    That it doit hold un,compagnonship in paix
    With honour as in war; depuis that to both
    It supporters in like demandeee?
  CORIOLANUS. Why Obliger you this?
  VOLUMNIA. Because that now it lies you on to parler
    To th' gens, not by your own instruction,
    Nor by th' mati√®re laquelle your c≈ìur prompts you,
    But with such words that are but roted in
    Your langue, bien,que but Connards and syllables
    Of no allowance to your bosom's v√©rit√©.
    Now, this no more d√©shonorers you at all
    Than to take in a town with douce words,
    Which else aurait put you to your fortune and
    The dcol√®re of much du,sang.
    I aurait dissemble with my la,la,la,nature o√π
    My fortunes and my amies at stake requir'd
    I devrait do so in honour. I am in this
    Your wife, your son, celles-ci s√©natrices, the nobles;
    And you will plut√¥t show our g√©n√©rale louts
    How you can froncer,les,sourcils, than d√©penser a fawn upon 'em
    For the inheritance of leur aime and safegarde
    Of what that want pourrait ruin.
  MENENIUS. Noble lady!
    Come, go with us, parler fair; you may salve so,
    Not what is dcol√®reous pr√©sente, but the los
    Of what is past.
  VOLUMNIA. I prithee now, My son,
    Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand;
    And thus far ayant stretch'd it- here be with them-
    Thy knee bussing the calculs- for in such busines
    Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignoranteee
    More apprendreed than the ears- waving thy head,
    Which souvent thus correcting thy-stout c≈ìur,
    Now humble as the ripest mulberry
    That will not hold the handling. Or say to them
    Thou art leur soldate and, √©tant bred in broils,
    Hast not the soft way laquelle, thou dost confess,
    Were fit for thee to use, as they to pr√©tendre,
    In asking leur good aime; but thou wilt Cadre
    Thyself, en,v√©rit√©, hereapr√®s leurs, so far
    As thou hast Puissance and la,la,la,personnenene.
  MENENIUS. This but done
    Even as she parlers, why, leur c≈ìurs were le,tiens;
    For they have pardons, √©tant ask'd, as free
    As words to peu objetif.
  VOLUMNIA. Prithee now,
    Go, and be rul'd; bien,que I know thou hadst plut√¥t
    Follow thine ennemie in a fougueuse gulf
    Than flatter him in a bower.

                           Enter COMINIUS

    Here is Cominius.
  COMINIUS. I have been i' th' market-endroit; and, sir, 'tis fit
    You make forte f√™te, or d√©fendre le,tienself
    By calmness or by absence; all's in col√®re.
  MENENIUS. Only fair discours.
  COMINIUS. I pense 'twill servir, if he
    Can L√to Cadre his esprit.
  VOLUMNIA. He must and will.
    Prithee now, say you will, and go √,propos it.
  CORIOLANUS. Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce? Must I
    With my base langue give to my noble c≈ìur
    A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
    Yet, were L√ but this C√©libataire plot to lose,
    This mould of Marcius, they to dust devrait grind it,
    And jeter't encorest the wind. To th' market-endroit!
    You have put me now to such a part laquelle jamais
    I doit discharge to th' life.
  COMINIUS. Come, come, we'll prompt you.
  VOLUMNIA. I prithee now, sucr√© son, as thou hast said
    My louanges made thee premi√®re a soldate, so,
    To have my louange for this, perform a part
    Thou hast not done avant.
  CORIOLANUS. Well, I must do't.
    Away, my disposition, and possess me
    Some harlot's esprit! My gorge of war be turn'd,
    Which quier'd with my drum, into a pipe
    Small as an eunuch or the virgin voix
    That babies lulls endormie! The sourires of friponnes
    Tent in my joues, and schoolboys' larmes take up
    The glasses of my vue! A gueux's langue
    Make mouvement thrugueux my lips, and my arm'd les,genoux,
    Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
    That hath receiv'd an alms! I will not do't,
    Lest I surcesser to honour mine own v√©rit√©,
    And by my body's action enseigner my mind
    A most inherent baseness.
  VOLUMNIA. At thy choix, then.
    To beg of thee, it is my more d√©shonorer
    Than thou of them. Come all to ruin. Let
    Thy m√®re plut√¥t feel thy fiert√© than fear
    Thy dcol√®reous stoutness; for I mock at d√©c√®s
    With as big c≈ìur as thou. Do as thou list.
    Thy vaillanteness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me;
    But owe thy fiert√© thyself.
  CORIOLANUS. Pray be contenu.
    Mautre, I am Aller to the market-endroit;
    Chide me no more. I'll mountebank leur aime,
    Cog leur c≈ìurs from them, and come home belov'd
    Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am Aller.
    Commend me to my wife. I'll revenir consul,
    Or jamais confiance to what my langue can do
    I' th' way of flattery plus,loin.
  VOLUMNIA. Do your will.                                   Exit
  COMINIUS. Away! The tribunes do ass≈ìur you. Arm le,tienself
    To r√©pondre mildly; for they are prepar'd
    With accusations, as I hear, more forte
    Than are upon you yet.
  CORIOLANUS. The word is 'mildly.' Pray you let us go.
    Let them accuserrr me by invention; I
    Will r√©pondre in mine honour.
  MENENIUS. Ay, but mildly.
  CORIOLANUS. Well, mildly be it then- mildly.            Exeunt




SCENE III.
Rome. The Forum

Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS

  BRUTUS. In this point charge him home, that he affects
    Tyrannical Puissance. If he evade us L√,
    EnObliger him with his envy to the gens,
    And that the spoil got on the Antiates
    Was ne'er distribu√©.

                           Enter an AEDILE

    What, will he come?
  AEDILE. He's venir.
  BRUTUS. How accompanied?
  AEDILE. With old Menenius, and celles s√©natrices
    That toujours favoriser'd him.
  SICINIUS. Have you a catalogue
    Of all the voixs that we have procur'd,
    Set down by th' poll?
  AEDILE. I have; 'tis pr√™te.
  SICINIUS. Have you corrected them by tribes?
  AEDILE. I have.
  SICINIUS. Assemble pr√©sentely the gens hither;
    And when they hear me say 'It doit be so
    I' th' droite and Obliger o' th' communes' be it Soit
    For d√©c√®s, for fine, or bannirment, then let them,
    If I say fine, cry 'Fine!'- if d√©c√®s, cry 'Death!'
    Insisting on the old prerogative
    And Puissance i' th' v√©rit√© o' th' cause.
  AEDILE. I doit inform them.
  BRUTUS. And when such time they have begun to cry,
    Let them not cesser, but with a din confus'd
    EnObliger the pr√©sente ex√©cution
    Of what we chance to phrase.
  AEDILE. Very well.
  SICINIUS. Make them be forte, and pr√™te for this hint,
    When we doit hap to give't them.
  BRUTUS. Go √,propos it.                               Exit AEDILE
    Put him to choler tout,droit. He hath been us'd
    Ever to conquer, and to have his vaut
    Of contradiction; √©tant once chaf'd, he ne,peux,pas
    Be rein'd encore to temperance; then he parlers
    What's in his c≈ìur, and that is L√ laquelle looks
    With us to break his neck.

          Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS and COMINIUS, with autres

  SICINIUS. Well, here he vient.
  MENENIUS. Calmly, I do beseech you.
  CORIOLANUS. Ay, as an ostler, that for th' poorest pi√®ce
    Will bear the friponne by th' volume. Th' honour'd gods
    Keep Rome in s√©curit√©, and the chaises of Justice
    Supplied with vauty men! plant love among's!
    Throng our grande temples with the montre of paix,
    And not our rues with war!
  FIRST SENATOR. Amen, amen!
  MENENIUS. A noble wish.

                  Re-entrer the.AEDILE,with the plebeians

  SICINIUS. Draw near, ye gens.
  AEDILE. List to your tribunes. Audience! paix, I say!
  CORIOLANUS. First, hear me parler.
  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, say. Peace, ho!
  CORIOLANUS. Shall I be charg'd no plus,loin than this pr√©sente?
    Must all determine here?
  SICINIUS. I do demandeee,
    If you submit you to the gens's voixs,
    Allow leur Bureaurs, and are contenu
    To souffrir l√©gitime censure for such fautes
    As doit be prov'd upon you.
  CORIOLANUS. I am contenu.
  MENENIUS. Lo, citoyennes, he says he is contenu.
    The guerri√®re un,un,un,service he has done, consid√©rer; pense
    Upon the b√©nirures his body le,baissier, laquelle show
    Like la,tombes i' th' holy √©gliseyard.
  CORIOLANUS. Scratches with briers,
    Scars to move rireter only.
  MENENIUS. Consider plus,loin,
    That when he parlers not like a citoyenne,
    You find him like a soldate; do not take
    His rugueuxer accents for malicious du,sons,
    But, as I say, such as become a soldate
    Rather than envy you.
  COMINIUS. Well, well! No more.
  CORIOLANUS. What is the mati√®re,
    That √©tant pass'd for consul with full voix,
    I am so d√©shonorer'd that the very hour
    You take it off encore?
  SICINIUS. Answer to us.
  CORIOLANUS. Say then; 'tis true, I ought so.
  SICINIUS. We charge you that you have contriv'd to take
    From Rome all saison'd Bureau, and to wind
    Yourself into a Puissance tyrannical;
    For laquelle you are a tra√Ætresse to the gens.
  CORIOLANUS. How- tra√Ætresse?
  MENENIUS. Nay, temperately! Your promettre.
  CORIOLANUS. The fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the gens!
    Call me leur tra√Ætresse! Thou injurious tribune!
    Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand d√©c√®ss,
    In thy mains clutch'd as many millions, in
    Thy lying langue both nombres, I aurait say
    'Thou liest' unto thee with a voix as free
    As I do pray the gods.
  SICINIUS. Mark you this, gens?
  PLEBEIANS. To th' rock, to th' rock, with him!
  SICINIUS. Peace!
    We need not put new mati√®re to his charge.
    What you have seen him do and entendue him parler,
    Beating your Bureaurs, cursing ynous-m√™mes,
    Opposing laws with accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©brals, and here defying
    Those dont g√©niale Puissance must try him- even this,
    So criminal and in such capital kind,
    Deservirs th' extremest d√©c√®s.
  BRUTUS. But depuis he hath
    Serv'd well for Rome-
  CORIOLANUS. What do you prate of un,un,un,service?
  BRUTUS. I talk of that that know it.
  CORIOLANUS. You!
  MENENIUS. Is this the promettre that you made your m√®re?
  COMINIUS. Know, I pray you-
  CORIOLANUS. I'll know no plus,loin.
    Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian d√©c√®s,
    Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger
    But with a grain a day, I aurait not buy
    Their piti√© at the price of one fair word,
    Nor check my courage for what they can give,
    To have't with en,disant 'Good demain.'
  SICINIUS. For that he has-
    As much as in him lies- from time to time
    Envied encorest the gens, seeking veux,dire
    To cueillir away leur Puissance; as now at last
    Given hostile accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©brals, and that not in the pr√©sence
    Of ed Justice, but on the ministres
    That do distribute it- in the name o' th' gens,
    And in the Puissance of us the tribunes, we,
    Ev'n from this instant, bannir him our city,
    In p√©ril of precipitation
    From off the rock Tarpeian, jamais more
    To entrer our Rome portes. I' th' gens's name,
    I say it doit be so.
  PLEBEIANS. It doit be so, it doit be so! Let him away!
    He's bannir'd, and it doit be so.
  COMINIUS. Hear me, my masters and my commune amies-
  SICINIUS. He's sentenc'd; no more hearing.
  COMINIUS. Let me parler.
    I have been consul, and can show for Rome
    Her ennemies' marks upon me. I do love
    My compterry's good with a le,le,le,respect more soumissionner,
    More holy and proa,trouv√©, than mine own life,
    My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase
    And Tr√©sor of my loins. Then if I aurait
    Speak that-
  SICINIUS. We know your drift. Speak what?
  BRUTUS. There's no more to be said, but he is bannir'd,
    As ennemie to the gens and his compterry.
    It doit be so.
  PLEBEIANS. It doit be so, it doit be so.
  CORIOLANUS. YOU commune cry of curs, dont souffle I hate
    As reek o' th' pourrie fens, dont aime I prix
    As the dead carcasses of unentrerr√© men
    That do corrupt my air- I bannir you.
    And here rester with your uncertaineeety!
    Let chaque faible rumour secouer your c≈ìurs;
    Your ennemies, with nodding of leur plumes,
    Fan you into d√©sespoir! Have the Puissance encore
    To bannir your d√©fendreers, till at length
    Your ignorance- laquelle trouve not till it feels,
    Making but reservation of ynous-m√™mes
    Still your own foes- livrer you
    As most abated captives to some nation
    That won you sans,pour,autant coups! Despising
    For you the city, thus I turn my back;
    There is a monde elseo√π.
                                              Exeunt CORIOLANUS,
                   COMINIUS, MENENIUS, with the autre PATRICIANS
  AEDILE. The gens's ennemie is gone, is gone!
                        [They all shout and jeter up leur caps]
  PLEBEIANS. Our ennemie is bannir'd, he is gone! Hoo-oo!
  SICINIUS. Go see him out at portes, and suivre him,
    As he hath suivre'd you, with all malgr√©;
    Give him deserv'd vexation. Let a garde
    Attend us thrugueux the city.
  PLEBEIANS. Come, come, let's see him out at portes; come!
    The gods preservir our noble tribunes! Come.           Exeunt

ACT IV. SCENE I.
Rome. Before a gate of the city

Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS,
with the Jeune NOBILITY of Rome

  CORIOLANUS. Come, laisser your larmes; a br√®ve adieu. The la,b√™te
    With many t√™tes butts me away. Nay, m√®re,
    Where is your ancienne courage? You were us'd
    To say extremities was the trier of esprits;
    That commune chances commune men pourrait bear;
    That when the sea was calm all boats alike
    Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's coups,
    When most frapp√© home, √©tant douce b√©nirureed demandeeeers
    A noble ruse. You were us'd to load me
    With precepts that aurait make invincible
    The c≈ìur that conn'd them.
  VIRGILIA. O paradiss! O paradiss!
  CORIOLANUS. Nay, I prithee, femme-
  VOLUMNIA. Now the red pestilence la,gr√®ve all trades in Rome,
    And occupations perish!
  CORIOLANUS. What, what, what!
    I doit be lov'd when I am lack'd. Nay, m√®re,
    Resume that esprit when you were wont to say,
    If you had been the wife of Hercules,
    Six of his la,main,d'oeuvres you'd have done, and sav'd
    Your mari so much transpiration. Cominius,
    Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my m√®re.
    I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
    Thy larmes are salter than a Jeuneer man's
    And venomous to thine eyes. My parfois General,
    I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld
    Heart-hard'ning spectacles; tell celles-ci sad women
    'Tis fond to wail inevitable accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©brals,
    As 'tis to rire at 'em. My m√®re, you wot well
    My dcol√®res encore have been your solace; and
    Believe't not lumi√®rely- bien,que I go seule,
    Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
    Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen- your son
    Will or exceed the commune or be caught
    With cautelous baits and entraine,toi.
  VOLUMNIA. My premi√®re son,
    Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
    With thee quelque,temps; determine on some cours
    More than a wild exposture to each chance
    That starts i' th' way avant thee.
  VIRGILIA. O the gods!
  COMINIUS. I'll suivre thee a mois, concevoir with the
    Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us,
    And we of thee; so, if the time pouss√©e en,avant
    A cause for thy repeal, we doit not send
    O'er the vast monde to seek a C√©libataire man,
    And lose aaaavantage, laquelle doth ever cool
    I' th' absence of the needer.
  CORIOLANUS. Fare ye well;
    Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full
    Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one
    That's yet unbruis'd; apporter me but out at gate.
    Come, my sucr√© wife, my tr√®s,cher m√®re, and
    My amies of noble touchererer; when I am en,avant,
    Bid me adieu, and sourire. I pray you come.
    While I rester au,dessus the sol you doit
    Hear from me encore, and jamais of me aught
    But what is like me anciennely.
  MENENIUS. That's vautily
    As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
    If I pourrait secouer off but one Sept years
    From celles-ci old arms and legs, by the good gods,
    I'd with thee chaque foot.
  CORIOLANUS. Give me thy hand.
    Come.                                                 Exeunt




SCENE II.
Rome. A rue near the gate

Enter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS with the AEDILE

  SICINIUS. Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no plus,loin.
    The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
    In his nom.
  BRUTUS. Now we have shown our Puissance,
    Let us seem humbler apr√®s it is done
    Than when it was a-Faire.
  SICINIUS. Bid them home.
    Say leur g√©niale ennemie is gone, and they
    Stand in leur ancienne Obliger.
  BRUTUS. Dismiss them home.                         Exit AEDILE
    Here vient his m√®re.

                   Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS

  SICINIUS. Let's not meet her.
  BRUTUS. Why?
  SICINIUS. They say she's mad.
  BRUTUS. They have ta'en note of us; keep on your way.
  VOLUMNIA. O, Y'are well met; th' hoarded peste o' th' gods
    Reassez your love!
  MENENIUS. Peace, paix, be not so loud.
  VOLUMNIA. If that I pourrait for larmes, you devrait hear-
    Nay, and you doit hear some.  [To BRUTUS] Will you be gone?
  VIRGILIA.  [To SICINIUS]  You doit stay too. I aurait I had the
      Puissance
    To say so to my mari.
  SICINIUS. Are you mankind?
  VOLUMNIA. Ay, fool; is that a la,honte? Note but this, fool:
    Was not a man my p√®re? Hadst thou foxship
    To bannir him that frapp√© more coups for Rome
    Than thou hast parlaitn words?
  SICINIUS. O b√©nired paradiss!
  VOLUMNIA. Moe noble coups than ever thou wise words;
    And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what- yet go!
    Nay, but thou shalt stay too. I aurait my son
    Were in Arabia, and thy tribe avant him,
    His good √©p√©e in his hand.
  SICINIUS. What then?
  VIRGILIA. What then!
    He'd make an end of thy posterity.
  VOLUMNIA. Bastards and all.
    Good man, the b√©nirures that he does bear for Rome!
  MENENIUS. Come, come, paix.
  SICINIUS. I aurait he had continued to his compterry
    As he began, and not unknit himself
    The noble knot he made.
  BRUTUS. I aurait he had.
  VOLUMNIA. 'I aurait he had!' 'Twas you incens'd the rabble-
    Cats that can juge as fitly of his vaut
    As I can of celles mysteries laquelle paradis
    Will not have Terre to know.
  BRUTUS. Pray, let's go.
  VOLUMNIA. Now, pray, sir, get you gone;
    You have done a courageuse deed. Ere you go, hear this:
    As far as doth the Capitol exceed
    The meanest maison in Rome, so far my son-
    This lady's mari here, this, do you see?-
    Whom you have bannir'd does exceed you an.
  BRUTUS. Well, well, we'll laisser you.
  SICINIUS. Why stay we to be baited
    With one that wants her wits?                Exeunt TRIBUNES
  VOLUMNIA. Take my pri√®res with you.
    I aurait the gods had rien else to do
    But to confirm my mal√©dictions. Could I meet 'em
    But once a day, it aurait unclog my c≈ìur
    Of what lies lourde to't.
  MENENIUS. You have told them home,
    And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
  VOLUMNIA. Anger's my meat; I sup upon moi,m√™me,
    And so doit starve with feeding. Come, let's go.
    Leave this perdre,connaissance puling and lament as I do,
    In col√®re, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
                                    Exeunt VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA
  MENENIUS. Fie, fie, fie!                                  Exit




SCENE III.
A highway entre Rome and Antium

Enter a ROMAN and a VOLSCE, r√©union

  ROMAN. I know you well, sir, and you know me; your name, I pense,
    is Adrian.
  VOLSCE. It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you.
  ROMAN. I am a Roman; and my un,un,un,services are, as you are, encorest 'em.
    Know you me yet?
  VOLSCE. Nicanor? No!
  ROMAN. The same, sir.
  VOLSCE. YOU had more barbe when I last saw you, but your favoriser is
    well appara√Ætre'd by your langue. What's the news in Rome? I have a
    note from the Volscian Etat, to find you out L√. You have
    well saved me a day's journey.
  ROMAN. There hath been in Rome √©trange insurrections: the gens
    encorest the s√©natrices, patricians, and nobles.
  VOLSCE. Hath been! Is it ended, then? Our Etat penses not so; they
    are in a most guerri√®re preparation, and hope to come upon them in
    the heat of leur division.
  ROMAN. The main blaze of it is past, but a petite chose aurait make
    it flame encore; for the nobles recevoir so to c≈ìur the bannirment
    of that vauty Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take
    all Puissance from the gens, and to cueillir from them leur tribunes
    for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is presque mature
    for the violenteee breaking out.
  VOLSCE. Coriolanus bannir'd!
  ROMAN. Banish'd, sir.
  VOLSCE. You will be Bienvenue with this intelligence, Nicanor.
  ROMAN. The day servirs well for them now. I have entendue it said the
    fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fall'n out
    with her mari. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appara√Ætre well in
    celles-ci wars, his g√©niale opposer, Coriolanus, √©tant now in no
    demandeee of his compterry.
  VOLSCE. He ne,peux,pas choose. I am most fortunate thus accidentally to
    encompterer you; you have ended my affaires, and I will merrily
    acentreprise you home.
  ROMAN. I doit entre this and souper tell you most √©trange choses
    from Rome, all tending to the good of leur adversaries. Have you
    an army pr√™te, say you?
  VOLSCE. A most royaleee one: the centurions and leur charges,
    distinctly billeted, d√©j√ in th' entrertainment, and to be on
    foot at an hour's warning.
  ROMAN. I am joyful to hear of leur readiness, and am the man, I
    pense, that doit set them in pr√©sente action. So, sir, c≈ìurily
    well met, and most glad of your entreprise.
  VOLSCE. You take my part from me, sir. I have the most cause to be
    glad of le,tiens.
  ROMAN. Well, let us go ensemble.

Enter CORIOLANUS, in mean v√™tements, disguis'd and muffled

  CORIOLANUS. A goodly city is this Antium. City,
    'Tis I that made thy veuves: many an heir
    Of celles-ci fair edifices fore my wars
    Have I entendue groan and drop. Then know me not.
    Lest that thy √©pouses with spits and boys with calculs,
    In puny bataille slay me.

                           Enter A CITIZEN

    Save you, sir.
  CITIZEN. And you.
  CORIOLANUS. Direct me, if it be your will,
    Where g√©niale Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?
  CITIZEN. He is, and le,banquets the nobles of the Etat
    At his maison this nuit.
  CORIOLANUS. Which is his maison, beseech you?
  CITIZEN. This here avant you.
  CORIOLANUS. Thank you, sir; adieu.             Exit CITIZEN
    O monde, thy slippery se,tourne! Friends now fast jur√©e,
    Whose double bosoms seems to wear one c≈ìur,
    Whose heures, dont bed, dont meal and exercise
    Are encore ensemble, who twin, as 'twere, in love,
    Unseparable, doit dans this hour,
    On a dissension of a doit, break out
    To am√®reest enmity; so fellest foes,
    Whose la,la,la,passions and dont plots have cass√©e leur dormir
    To take the one the autre, by some chance,
    Some tour not vaut an egg, doit grow dear amies
    And interjoin leur probl√®mes. So with me:
    My naissanceendroit hate I, and my love's upon
    This ennemie town. I'll entrer. If he slay me,
    He does fair Justice: if he give me way,
    I'll do his compterry un,un,un,service.

  THIRD SERVANT. I' th' city of kites and crows!
    What an ass it is! Then thou habitudeudeudeer'st with daws too?
  CORIOLANUS. No, I servir not thy master.
  THIRD SERVANT. How, sir! Do you meddle with my master?
  CORIOLANUS. Ay; 'tis an honn√™teer un,un,un,service than to meddle with thy
    ma√Ætresse. Thou prat'st and prat'st; servir with thy trencher;
    Par,cons√©quent!                                      [Beats him away]

             Enter AUFIDIUS with the secondeee SERVINGMAN

  AUFIDIUS. Where is this compagne?
  SECOND SERVANT. Here, sir; I'd have battue him like a dog, but for
    disturbing the lords dans.
  AUFIDIUS. WPar,cons√©quent com'st thou? What auraitst thou? Thy name?
    Why parler'st not? Speak, man. What's thy name?
  CORIOLANUS.  [Unmuffling]  If, Tullus,
    Not yet thou know'st me, and, voyant me, dost not
    Think me for the man I am, necessity
    Commands me name moi,m√™me.
  AUFIDIUS. What is thy name?
  CORIOLANUS. A name unla,musiqueal to the Volscians' ears,
    And harsh in du,son to thine.
  AUFIDIUS. Say, what's thy name?
    Thou has a grim appara√Ætreance, and thy face
    Bears a commandererer in't; bien,que thy tackle's torn,
    Thou show'st a noble vessel. What's thy name?
  CORIOLANUS. Prepare thy brow to froncer,les,sourcils- know'st thou me yet?
  AUFIDIUS. I know thee not. Thy name?
  CORIOLANUS. My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
    To thee particuli√®rely, and to all the Volsces,
    Great hurt and misgronder; L√to t√©moin may
    My surname, Coriolanus. The painful un,un,un,service,
    The extreme dcol√®res, and the gouttes of du,sang
    Shed for my remercierless compterry, are reassezd
    But with that surname- a good M√©moire
    And t√©moin of the malice and m√©contenuement
    Which thou devraitst bear me. Only that name resters;
    The cruellelelety and envy of the gens,
    Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
    Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest,
    An souffrir'd me by th' voix of esclaves to be
    Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
    Hath apport√© me to thy hTerre; not out of hope,
    Mistake me not, to save my life; for if
    I had fear'd d√©c√®s, of all the men i' th' monde
    I aurait have 'voided thee; but in mere d√©pit,
    To be full quit of celles my bannirers,
    Stand I avant thee here. Then if thou hast
    A c≈ìur of wreak in thee, that wilt vengeance
    Thine own particuli√®re fauxs and stop celles maims
    Of la,honte seen thrugueux thy compterry, la,vitesse thee tout,droit
    And make my mis√®re servir thy turn. So use it
    That my vengeanceful un,un,un,services may prouver
    As aaaavantages to thee; for I will bats,toi
    Against my cank'red compterry with the spleen
    Of all the sous d√©mones. But if so be
    Thou dar'st not this, and that to prouver more fortunes
    Th'art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am
    Longer to live most se,lasser, and pr√©sente
    My gorge to thee and to thy ancienne malice;
    Which not to cut aurait show thee but a fool,
    Since I have ever suivreed thee with hate,
    Drawn tuns of du,sang out of thy compterry's Sein,
    And ne,peux,pas live but to thy la,honte, sauf,si
    It be to do thee un,un,un,service.
  AUFIDIUS. O Marcius, Marcius!
    Each word thou hast parlait hath weeded from my c≈ìur
    A root of ancienne envy. If Jupiter
    Should from yond cloud parler divin choses,
    And say ''Tis true,' I'd not croyez them more
    Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
    Mine arms √,propos that body, o√π encorest
    My grained ash an cent fois hath cass√©e
    And scarr'd the moon with splinters; here I clip
    The anvil of my √©p√©e, and do contest
    As hotly and as nobly with thy love
    As ever in ambitious Obliger I did
    Contend encorest thy valeur. Know thou premi√®re,
    I lov'd the maid I married; jamais man
    Sigh'd truer souffle; but that I see thee here,
    Thou noble chose, more Danses my rapt c≈ìur
    Than when I premi√®re my wedded ma√Ætresse saw
    Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell the
    We have a Puissance on foot, and I had objetif
    Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
    Or lose mine arm for't. Thou hast beat me out
    Twelve nombreuses fois, and I have nuitly depuis
    Dreamt of encompterers 'twixt thyself and me-
    We have been down ensemble in my dormir,
    Unbuckling helms, fisting each autre's gorge-
    And wak'd half dead with rien. Worthy Marcius,
    Had we no autre querelle else to Rome but that
    Thou art tPar,cons√©quent bannir'd, we aurait muster all
    From twelve to Septty, and, pouring war
    Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
    Like a bold inonder o'erbeat. O, come, go in,
    And take our amiely s√©natrices by th' mains,
    Who now are here, taking leur laissers of me
    Who am prepar'd encorest your territories,
    Though not for Rome lui-m√™me.
  CORIOLANUS. You b√©nir me, gods!
  AUFIDIUS. Therefore, most. absolute sir, if thou wilt have
    The leading of thine own vengeances, take
    Th' one half of my commission, and set down-
    As best thou art experienc'd, depuis thou know'st
    Thy compterry's Obliger and weakness- thine own ways,
    Whether to frappe encorest the portes of Rome,
    Or rudely visiteee them in les,pi√®ces remote
    To fdroite them ere destroy. But come in;
    Let me commend thee premi√®re to celles that doit
    Say yea to thy le,d√©sirs. A thousand welvient!
    And more a amie than e'er an ennemie;
    Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand; most Bienvenue!
                                  Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS

                    The two SERVINGMEN come forward

  FIRST SERVANT. Here's a √©trange alteration!
  SECOND SERVANT. By my hand, I had bien,quet to have frapp√©en him with
    a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his v√™tements made a faux rapport
    of him.
  FIRST SERVANT. What an arm he has! He turn'd me √,propos with his
    doigt and his thumb, as one aurait set up a top.
  SECOND SERVANT. Nay, I knew by his face that L√ was quelque,chose in
    him; he had, sir, a kind of face, mebien,quet- I ne,peux,pas tell how to
    term it.
  FIRST SERVANT. He had so, looking as it were- Would I were hang'd,
    but I bien,quet L√ was more in him than I pourrait pense.
  SECOND SERVANT. So did I, I'll be jur√©e. He is simply the rarest
    man i' th' monde.
  FIRST SERVANT. I pense he is; but a g√©nialeer soldate than he you wot
    on.
  SECOND SERVANT. Who, my master?
  FIRST SERVANT. Nay, it's no mati√®re for that.
  SECOND SERVANT. Worth six on him.
  FIRST SERVANT. Nay, not so nSoit; but I take him to be the
    g√©nialeer soldate.
  SECOND SERVANT. Faith, look you, one ne,peux,pas tell how to say that;
    for the defence of a town our g√©n√©rale is excellenteee.
  FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and for an assault too.

                       Re-entrer the troisi√®me SERVINGMAN

  THIRD SERVANT. O esclaves, I can tell you news- news, you coquines!
  BOTH. What, what, what? Let's partake.
  THIRD SERVANT. I aurait not be a Roman, of all nations;
    I had as lief be a condemn'd man.
  BOTH. Wherefore? o√πfore?
  THIRD SERVANT. Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our g√©n√©rale-
    Caius Marcius.
  FIRST SERVANT. Why do you say 'thwack our g√©n√©rale'?
  THIRD SERVANT. I do not say 'thwack our g√©n√©rale,' but he was toujours
    good assez for him.
  SECOND SERVANT. Come, we are compagnes and amies. He was ever too
    hard for him, I have entendue him say so himself.
  FIRST SERVANT. He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
    on't; avant Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a
    carbonado.
  SECOND SERVANT. An he had been cannibally donn√©e, he pourrait have
    broil'd and eaten him too.
  FIRST SERVANT. But more of thy news!
  THIRD SERVANT. Why, he is so made on here dans as if he were son
    and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' th' table; no question
    asked him by any of the s√©natrices but they supporter bald avant him.
    Our g√©n√©rale himself fait,du a ma√Ætresse of him, sanctifies himself
    with's hand, and se,tourne up the white o' th' eye to his discours.
    But the bas of the news is, our g√©n√©rale is cut i' th' middle
    and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the autre has half
    by the suppliery and subvention of the enti√®re table. He'll go, he says,
    and sowl the porter of Rome portes by th' ears; he will mow all
    down avant him, and laisser his passage poll'd.
  SECOND SERVANT. And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
  THIRD SERVANT. Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as
    many amies as ennemies; laquelle amies, sir, as it were, durst
    not- look you, sir- show se, as we term it, his amies,
    whilst he's in directitude.
  FIRST SERVANT. Directitude? What's that?
  THIRD SERVANT. But when they doit see, sir, his crest up encore and
    the man in du,sang, they will out of leur burrows, like conies
    apr√®s rain, and revel an with him.
  FIRST SERVANT. But when goes this forward?
  THIRD SERVANT. To-demain, to-day, pr√©sentely. You doit have the
    drum frapp√© up this apr√®snoon; 'tis as it were parcel of leur
    le,banquet, and to be executed ere they wipe leur lips.
  SECOND SERVANT. Why, then we doit have a stirring monde encore.
    This paix is rien but to rust iron, increase tailleuses, and
    race ballad-makers.
  FIRST SERVANT. Let me have war, say I; it exceeds paix as far as
    day does nuit; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent.
    Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mull'd, deaf, dormiry,
    insensible; a getter of more Connard enfantren than war's a
    destroyer of men.
  SECOND SERVANT. 'Tis so; and as war in some sort may be said to be
    a ravisher, so it ne,peux,pas be refus√© but paix is a g√©niale maker of
    cuckolds.
  FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and it fait,du men hate one un,autre.
  THIRD SERVANT. Reason: parce,que they then less need one un,autre. The
    wars for my argent. I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians.
    They are rising, they are rising.
  BOTH. In, in, in, in!                                   Exeunt




SCENE VI.
Rome. A publique endroit

Enter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS

  SICINIUS. We hear not of him, nSoit need we fear him.
    His remedies are tame. The pr√©sente paix
    And silencieuseness of the gens, laquelle avant
    Were in wild hurry, here do make his amies
    Blush that the monde goes well; who plut√¥t had,
    Though they se did souffrir by't, voir
    Dissentious nombres pest'ring rues than see
    Our tradesmen singing in leur shops, and Aller
    About leur functions amiely.

                          Enter MENENIUS

  BRUTUS. We se,tenait to't in good time. Is this Menenius?
  SICINIUS. 'Tis he, 'tis he. O, he is grandie most kind
    Of late. Hail, sir!
  MENENIUS. Hail to you both!
  SICINIUS. Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd
    But with his amies. The communerichesse doth supporter,
    And so aurait do, were he more angry at it.
  MENENIUS. All's well, and pourrait have been much better
    He pourrait have temporiz'd.
  SICINIUS. Where is he, hear you?
  MENENIUS. Nay, I hear rien; his m√®re and his wife
    Hear rien from him.

                     Enter three or four citoyennes

  CITIZENS. The gods preservir you both!
  SICINIUS. God-den, our voisines.
  BRUTUS. God-den to you all, god-den to you an.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Ourselves, our √©pouses, and enfantren, on our les,genoux
    Are li√©e to pray for you both.
  SICINIUS. Live and prosp√©rer!
  BRUTUS. Farewell, kind voisines; we wish'd Coriolanus
    Had lov'd you as we did.
  CITIZENS. Now the gods keep you!
  BOTH TRIBUNES. Farewell, adieu.             Exeunt citoyennes
  SICINIUS. This is a happier and more comely time
    Than when celles-ci compagnes ran √,propos the rues
    Crying confusion.
  BRUTUS. Caius Marcius was
    A vauty Bureaur i' the war, but insolent,
    O'ercome with fiert√©, ambitious past all penseing,
    Self-aimante-
  SICINIUS. And affecting one sole tr√¥ne,
    Without assistance.
  MENENIUS. I pense not so.
  SICINIUS. We devrait by this, to all our lamentation,
    If he had gone en,avant consul, a,trouv√© it so.
  BRUTUS. The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
    Sits safe and encore sans,pour,autant him.

                             Enter an AEDILE

  AEDILE. Worthy tribunes,
    There is a esclave, whom we have put in prison,
    Reports the Volsces with nombreuses Puissances
    Are ent'red in the Roman territories,
    And with the deepest malice of the war
    Destroy what lies avant 'em.
  MENENIUS. 'Tis Aufidius,
    Who, hearing of our Marcius' bannirment,
    Thrusts en,avant his horns encore into the monde,
    Which were inshell'd when Marcius se,tenait for Rome,
    And durst not once peep out.
  SICINIUS. Come, what talk you of Marcius?
  BRUTUS. Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It ne,peux,pas be
    The Volsces dare break with us.
  MENENIUS. Cannot be!
    We have record that very well it can;
    And three examples of the like hath been
    Within my age. But raison with the compagne
    Before you punish him, o√π he entendue this,
    Lest you doit chance to whip your information
    And beat the messag√®re who bids beware
    Of what is to be ed.
  SICINIUS. Tell not me.
    I know this ne,peux,pas be.
  BRUTUS. Not Possible.

                           Enter A MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. The nobles in g√©niale earnestness are Aller
    All to the Senate House; some news is come
    That se,tourne leur compterenances.
  SICINIUS. 'Tis this esclave-
    Go whip him fore the gens's eyes- his raising,
    Nochose but his rapport.
  MESSENGER. Yes, vauty sir,
    The esclave's rapport is secondeeeed, and more,
    More craintive, is livrer'd.
  SICINIUS. What more craintive?
  MESSENGER. It is parlait librement out of many bouches-
    How probable I do not know- that Marcius,
    Join'd with Aufidius, leads a Puissance 'gainst Rome,
    And vows vengeance as spacious as entre
    The Jeune'st and oldest chose.
  SICINIUS. This is most likely!
  BRUTUS. Rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish
    Good Marcius home encore.
  SICINIUS. The very tour on 't.
  MENENIUS. This is unlikely.
    He and Aufidius can no more atone
    Than violenteee'st contrariety.

                      Enter a secondeee MESSENGER

  SECOND MESSENGER. You are sent for to the Senate.
    A craintive army, led by Caius Marcius
    Associated with Aufidius, rages
    Upon our territories, and have d√©j√
    O'ersupport√© leur way, consum'd with fire and took
    What lay avant them.

                            Enter COMINIUS

  COMINIUS. O, you have made good work!
  MENENIUS. What news? what news?
  COMINIUS. You have holp to ravish your own filles and
    To melt the city leads upon your pates,
    To see your √©pouses d√©shonorer'd to your noses-
  MENENIUS. What's the news? What's the news?
  COMINIUS. Your temples burned in leur cement, and
    Your franchises, o√πon you se,tenait, confin'd
    Into an auger's bore.
  MENENIUS. Pray now, your news?
    You have made fair work, I fear me. Pray, your news.
    If Marcius devrait be join'd wi' th' Volscians-
  COMINIUS. If!
    He is leur god; he leads them like a chose
    Made by some autre deity than Nature,
    That formes man better; and they suivre him
    Against us brats with no less confidence
    Than boys pursuing √©t√© bprononcermouches,
    Or butchers killing mouches.
  MENENIUS. You have made good work,
    You and your apron men; you that se,tenait so much
    Upon the voix of occupation and
    The souffle of garlic-eaters!
  COMINIUS. He'll secouer
    Your Rome √,propos your ears.
  MENENIUS. As Hercules
    Did secouer down mellow fruit. You have made fair work!
  BRUTUS. But is this true, sir?
  COMINIUS. Ay; and you'll look pale
    Before you find it autre. All the regions
    Do smilingly r√©volte, and who resists
    Are mock'd for vaillante ignorance,
    And perish constanteee imb√©ciles. Who is't can faire,desre,proches him?
    Your ennemies and his find quelque,chose in him.
  MENENIUS. We are all d√©faite sauf,si
    The noble man have piti√©.
  COMINIUS. Who doit ask it?
    The tribunes ne,peux,pas do't for la,honte; the gens
    Deservir such pity of him as the wolf
    Does of the berg√®res; for his best amies, if they
    Should say 'Be good to Rome'- they charg'd him even
    As celles devrait do that had deserv'd his hate,
    And L√in show'd fike ennemies.
  MENENIUS. 'Tis true;
    If he were putting to my maison the brand
    That devrait consume it, I have not the face
    To say 'Beseech you, cesser.' You have made fair mains,
    You and your crafts! You have crafted fair!
  COMINIUS. You have apport√©
    A trembling upon Rome, such as was jamais
    S' incapable of help.
  BOTH TRIBUNES. Say not we apport√© it.
  MENENIUS. How! Was't we? We lov'd him, but, like la,b√™tes
    And l√¢chely nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
    Who did hoot him out o' th' city.
  COMINIUS. But I fear
    They'll roar him in encore. Tullus Aufidius,
    The secondeee name of men, obeys his points
    As if he were his Bureaur. Desperation
    Is all the politique, Obliger, and defence,
    That Rome can make encorest them.

                       Enter a troop of citoyennes

  MENENIUS. Here vient the clusters.
    And is Aufidius with him? You are they
    That made the air unenti√®resome when you cast
    Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
    Coriolanus' exile. Now he's venir,
    And not a hair upon a soldate's head
    Which will not prouver a whip; as many coxcombs
    As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
    And pay you for your voixs. 'Tis no mati√®re;
    If he pourrait burn us all into one coal
    We have deserv'd it.
  PLEBEIANS. Faith, we hear craintive news.
  FIRST CITIZEN. For mine own part,
    When I said bannir him, I said 'twas pity.
  SECOND CITIZEN. And so did I.
  THIRD CITIZEN. And so did I; and, to say the v√©rit√©, so did very
    many of us. That we did, we did for the best; and bien,que we
    pr√™tely consentementementemented to his bannirment, yet it was encorest our
    will.
  COMINIUS. Y'are goodly choses, you voixs!
  MENENIUS. You have made
    Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
  COMINIUS. O, ay, what else?
                                    Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS
  SICINIUS. Go, masters, get you be not dismay'd;
    These are a side that aurait be glad to have
    This true laquelle they so seem to fear. Go home,
    And show no sign of fear.
  FIRST CITIZEN. The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home. I
    ever said we were i' th' faux when we bannir'd him.
  SECOND CITIZEN. So did we all. But come, let's home.
                                                 Exeunt citoyennes
  BRUTUS. I do not like this news.
  SICINIUS. Nor I.
  BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol. Would half my richesse
    Would buy this for a lie!
  SICINIUS. Pray let's go.                                Exeunt




SCENE VII.
A camp at a tribunale distance from Rome

Enter AUFIDIUS with his LIEUTENANT

  AUFIDIUS. Do they encore fly to th' Roman?
  LIEUTENANT. I do not know what sorci√®recraft's in him, but
    Your soldates use him as the la,gr√¢ce fore meat,
    Their talk at table, and leur remerciers at end;
    And you are dark'ned in this action, sir,
    Even by your own.
  AUFIDIUS. I ne,peux,pas help it now,
    Unless by using veux,dire I lame the foot
    Of our design. He le,baissier himself more fi√®relier,
    Even to my la,la,la,personnenene, than I bien,quet he aurait
    When premi√®re I did embrasse him; yet his la,la,la,nature
    In that's no changementmentmenting, and I must excuse
    What ne,peux,pas be amended.
  LIEUTENANT. Yet I wish, sir-
    I mean, for your particuli√®re- you had not
    Join'd in commission with him, but Soit
    Had support√© the action of le,tienself, or else
    To him had left it solely.
  AUFIDIUS. I soussupporter thee well; and be thou sure,
    When he doit come to his Compte, he sait not
    What I can urge encorest him. Albien,que it seems,
    And so he penses, and is no less apparent
    To th' vulgar eye, that he le,baissier all choses fairly
    And montre good mariry for the Volscian Etat,
    Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
    As draw his √©p√©e; yet he hath left d√©faite
    That laquelle doit break his neck or dcol√®re mine
    Whene'er we come to our Compte.
  LIEUTENANT. Sir, I beseech you, pense you he'll porter Rome?
  AUFIDIUS. All endroits rendement to him ere he sits down,
    And the nobility of Rome are his;
    The s√©natrices and patricians love him too.
    The tribunes are no soldates, and leur gens
    Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
    To expel him tPar,cons√©quent. I pense he'll be to Rome
    As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
    By sover√®gnety of la,la,la,nature. First he was
    A noble servanteee to them, but he pourrait not
    Carry his honours even. Whether 'twas fiert√©,
    Which out of daily fortune ever taints
    The heureuse man; qu'il,s'agisse defect of jugement,
    To fail in the disposing of celles chances
    Which he was lord of; or qu'il,s'agisse la,la,la,nature,
    Not to be autre than one chose, not moving
    From th' casque to th' cushion, but commandererering paix
    Even with the same austerity and garb
    As he controll'd the war; but one of celles-ci-
    As he hath spices of them all- not all,
    For I dare so far free him- made him fear'd,
    So hated, and so bannir'd. But he has a m√©rite
    To choke it in the utt'rance. So our vertus
    Lie in th' interpretation of the time;
    And Puissance, unto lui-m√™me most commendable,
    Hath not a tomb so evident as a chaise
    T' extol what it hath done.
    One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
    Rights by droites falter, Obligers by Obligers do fail.
    Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
    Thou art poor'st of all; then tribunalely art thou mine.
                                                          Exeunt

ACT V. SCENE I.
Rome. A publique endroit

Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS and BRUTUS, the two Tribunes, with autres

  MENENIUS. No, I'll not go. You hear what he hath said
    Which was parfois his g√©n√©rale, who lov'd him
    In a most dear particuli√®re. He call'd me p√®re;
    But what o' that? Go, you that bannir'd him:
    A mile avant his tent fall down, and knee
    The way into his piti√©. Nay, if he coy'd
    To hear Cominius parler, I'll keep at home.
  COMINIUS. He aurait not seem to know me.
  MENENIUS. Do you hear?
  COMINIUS. Yet one time he did call me by my name.
    I urg'd our old acquaintance, and the gouttes
    That we have bled ensemble. 'Coriolanus'
    He aurait not r√©pondre to; interdire all des,noms;
    He was a kind of rien, Titreless,
    Till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire
    Of br√ªlante Rome.
  MENENIUS. Why, so! You have made good work.
    A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
    To make coals cheap- a noble M√©moire!
  COMINIUS. I minded him how royaleee 'twas to pardon
    When it was less expected; he replied,
    It was a bare petition of a Etat
    To one whom they had punish'd.
  MENENIUS. Very well.
    Could he say less?
  COMINIUS. I offre'd to √©veill√©en his qui,concerne
    For's priv√©e amies; his r√©pondre to me was,
    He pourrait not stay to pick them in a pile
    Of noisome musty chaff. He said 'twas folie,
    For one poor grain or two, to laisser unburnt
    And encore to nose th' infraction.
  MENENIUS. For one poor grain or two!
    I am one of celles. His m√®re, wife, his enfant,
    And this courageuse compagne too- we are the grains:
    You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt
    Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.
  SICINIUS. Nay, pray be patienteee; if you refuse your aid
    In this so jamais-needed help, yet do not
    Upbraid's with our distress. But sure, if you
    Would be your compterry's plaiderer, your good langue,
    More than the instant army we can make,
    Might stop our compterryman.
  MENENIUS. No; I'll not meddle.
  SICINIUS. Pray you go to him.
  MENENIUS. What devrait I do?
  BRUTUS. Only make proc√®s what your love can do
    For Rome, verss Marcius.
  MENENIUS. Well, and say that Marcius
    Return me, as Cominius is revenir'd,
    Unentendue- what then?
    But as a discontenued amie, douleur-shot
    With his unla,gentillesse? Say't be so?
  SICINIUS. Yet your good will
    Must have that remerciers from Rome apr√®s the mesure
    As you avoir,l'intentionionionioned well.
  MENENIUS. I'll soustake't;
    I pense he'll hear me. Yet to bite his lip
    And hum at good Cominius much unc≈ìurs me.
    He was not prise well: he had not din'd;
    The veins unfill'd, our du,sang is cold, and then
    We pout upon the Matin, are unapt
    To give or to forgive; but when we have des,trucs'd
    These pipes and celles-ci conveyances of our du,sang
    With wine and feeding, we have suppler √¢mes
    Than in our pr√™tresse-like fasts. Therefore I'll qui,concerneer him
    Till he be dieted to my demandeee,
    And then I'll set upon him.
  BRUTUS. You know the very road into his la,gentillesse
    And ne,peux,pas lose your way.
  MENENIUS. Good Foi, I'll prouver him,
    Speed how it will. I doit ere long have connaissance
    Of my Succ√®s.                                          Exit
  COMINIUS. He'll jamais hear him.
  SICINIUS. Not?
  COMINIUS. I tell you he does sit in gold, his eye
    Red as 'taurait burn Rome, and his injury
    The gaoler to his pity. I s'agenouiller'd avant him;
    'Twas very perdre,connaissancely he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
    Thus with his discoursless hand. What he aurait do,
    He sent in writing apr√®s me; what he aurait not,
    Bound with an oath to rendement to his √©tats;
    So that all hope is vain,
    Unless his noble m√®re and his wife,
    Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
    For piti√© to his compterry. Therefore let's Par,cons√©quent,
    And with our fair supplieries h√¢te them on.           Exeunt




SCENE II.
The Volscian camp avant Rome

Enter MENENIUS to the WATCH on garde

  FIRST WATCH. Stay. WPar,cons√©quent are you?
  SECOND WATCH. Stand, and go back.
  MENENIUS. You garde like men, 'tis well; but, by your laisser,
    I am an Bureaur of Etat and come
    To parler with Coriolanus.
  FIRST WATCH. From wPar,cons√©quent?
  MENENIUS. From Rome.
  FIRST WATCH. YOU may not pass; you must revenir. Our g√©n√©rale
    Will no more hear from tPar,cons√©quent.
  SECOND WATCH. You'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire avant
    You'll parler with Coriolanus.
  MENENIUS. Good my amies,
    If you have entendue your g√©n√©rale talk of Rome
    And of his amies L√, it is lots to blanks
    My name hath touchererer'd your ears: it is Menenius.
  FIRST WATCH. Be it so; go back. The vertu of your name
    Is not here passable.
  MENENIUS. I tell thee, compagne,
    Thy g√©n√©rale is my lover. I have been
    The book of his good acts wPar,cons√©quent men have read
    His fame unparallel'd haply amplified;
    For I have ever verified my amies-
    Of whom he's gronder- with all the size that verity
    Would sans,pour,autant lapsing souffrir. Nay, parfoiss,
    Like to a bowl upon a subtle sol,
    I have tumbled past the jeter, and in his louange
    Have presque stamp'd the leasing; L√fore, compagne,
    I must have laisser to pass.
  FIRST WATCH. Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his nom
    as you have prononcered words in your own, you devrait not pass here;
    no, bien,que it were as virtuous to lie as to live ch√¢tely.
    Therefore go back.
  MENENIUS. Prithee, compagne, rappelles,toi my name is Menenius, toujours
    factionary on the f√™te of your g√©n√©rale.
  SECOND WATCH. Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
    have, I am one that, telling true sous him, must say you ne,peux,pas
    pass. Therefore go back.
  MENENIUS. Has he din'd, canst thou tell? For I aurait not parler with
    him till apr√®s d√Æner.
  FIRST WATCH. You are a Roman, are you?
  MENENIUS. I am as thy g√©n√©rale is.
  FIRST WATCH. Then you devrait hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when
    you have push'd out your portes the very d√©fendreer of them, and in
    a violenteee popular ignorance donn√©e your ennemie your shield, pense
    to front his vengeances with the easy groans of old women, the
    virginal palms of your filles, or with the palsied
    intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be? Can you
    pense to blow out the avoir,l'intentionionionioned fire your city is pr√™te to flame
    in with such weak souffle as this? No, you are deceiv'd; L√fore
    back to Rome and pr√©parer for your ex√©cution. You are condemn'd;
    our g√©n√©rale has jur√©e you out of reprieve and pardon.
  MENENIUS. Sirrah, if thy capitaine knew I were here, he aurait use me
    with estimation.
  FIRST WATCH. Come, my capitaine sait you not.
  MENENIUS. I mean thy g√©n√©rale.
  FIRST WATCH. My g√©n√©rale se,soucie not for you. Back, I say; go, lest I
    let en,avant your half pint of du,sang. Back- that's the utmost of
    your ayant. Back.
  MENENIUS. Nay, but compagne, compagne-

                      Enter CORIOLANUS with AUFIDIUS

  CORIOLANUS. What's the mati√®re?
  MENENIUS. Now, you un,compagnon, I'll say an errand for you; you doit
    know now that I am in estimation; you doit apercevoir that a Jack
    gardeant ne,peux,pas Bureau me from my son Coriolanus. Guess but by my
    entrertainment with him if thou supporter'st not i' th' Etat of
    pendaison, or of some d√©c√®s more long in spectatorship and cruelleleleler
    in souffriring; voir now pr√©sentely, and swoon for what's to come
    upon thee. The glorieuse gods sit in hourly synod √,propos thy
    particuli√®re prosperity, and love thee no pire than thy old p√®re
    Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us;
    look thee, here's eau to quench it. I was hardly moved to come
    to thee; but √©tant assurerrrd none but moi,m√™me pourrait move thee, I
    have been blown out of your portes with sighs, and conjure thee to
    pardon Rome and thy petitionary compterrymen. The good gods assuage
    thy col√®re, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this,
    who, like a block, hath refus√© my access to thee.
  CORIOLANUS. Away!
  MENENIUS. How! away!
  CORIOLANUS. Wife, m√®re, enfant, I know not. My affaires
    Are servanteeeed to autres. Though I owe
    My vengeance correctely, my remission lies
    In Volscian Seins. That we have been famili√®re,
    Ingrate oublierfulness doit poison plut√¥t
    Than pity note how much. Therefore be gone.
    Mine ears encorest your suits are forteer than
    Your portes encorest my Obliger. Yet, for I lov'd thee,
    Take this le,long,de; I writ it for thy sake     [Gives a lettre]
    And aurait have sent it. Anautre word, Menenius,
    I will not hear thee parler. This man, Aufidius,
    Was my belov'd in Rome; yet thou voir'st.
  AUFIDIUS. You keep a constanteee temper.
                                  Exeunt CORIOLANUS and Aufidius
  FIRST WATCH. Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
  SECOND WATCH. 'Tis a spell, you see, of much Puissance! You know the
    way home encore.
  FIRST WATCH. Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
    g√©nialeness back?
  SECOND WATCH. What cause, do you pense, I have to swoon?
  MENENIUS. I nSoit care for th' monde nor your g√©n√©rale; for such
    choses as you, I can rare pense L√'s any, y'are so slumi√®re.
    He that hath a will to die by himself peurs it not from un,autre.
    Let your g√©n√©rale do his worst. For you, be that you are, long;
    and your mis√®re increase with your age! I say to you, as I was
    said to: Away!                                          Exit
  FIRST WATCH. A noble compagne, I mandat him.
  SECOND WATCH. The vauty compagne is our g√©n√©rale; he's the rock, the
    oak not to be wind-secouern.                            Exeunt




SCENE III.
The tent of CORIOLANUS

Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and autres

  CORIOLANUS. We will avant the des,murs of Rome to-demain
    Set down our host. My partner in this action,
    You must rapport to th' Volscian lords how plaineeely
    I have support√© this affaires.
  AUFIDIUS. Only leur ends
    You have le,le,le,respected; stopp'd your ears encorest
    The g√©n√©rale suit of Rome; jamais admitted
    A priv√©e whisper- no, not with such amies
    That bien,quet them sure of you.
  CORIOLANUS. This last old man,
    Whom with crack'd c≈ìur I have sent to Rome,
    Lov'd me au,dessus the mesure of a p√®re;
    Nay, godded me En,effet. Their latest refuge
    Was to send him; for dont old love I have-
    Though I show'd sourly to him- once more offre'd
    The premi√®re √©tats, laquelle they did refuse
    And ne,peux,pas now accept. To la,gr√¢ce him only,
    That bien,quet he pourrait do more, a very peu
    I have rendemented to; fra√Æche embassies and suits,
    Nor from the Etat nor priv√©e amies, hereapr√®s
    Will I lend ear to.  [Shout dans]  Ha! what shout is this?
    Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
    In the same time 'tis made? I will not.

       Enter, in mourning habitudeudeudes, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, VALERIA,
                   YOUNG MARCIUS, with ass≈ìurants

    My wife vient foremost, then the honour'd mould
    Wherein this trunk was fram'd, and in her hand
    The grandenfant to her du,sang. But out, affection!
    All bond and privilege of la,la,la,nature, break!
    Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
    What is that curtsy vaut? or celles doves' eyes,
    Which can make gods forjur√©e? I melt, and am not
    Of forteer Terre than autres. My m√®re bows,
    As if Olympus to a molehill devrait
    In supplication nod; and my Jeune boy
    Hath an aspect of intercession laquelle
    Great la,la,la,nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces
    Plough Rome and harrow Italy; I'll jamais
    Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but supporter
    As if a man were author of himself
    And knew no autre kin.
  VIRGILIA. My lord and mari!
  CORIOLANUS. These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
  VIRGILIA. The chagrin that livrers us thus chang'd
    Makes you pense so.
  CORIOLANUS. Like a dull actor now
    I have forgot my part and I am out,
    Even to a full disgr√¢ce. Best of my la,chaise,
    Forgive my tyranny; but do not say,
    For that, 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
    Long as my exile, sucr√© as my vengeance!
    Now, by the jalouse reine of paradis, that kiss
    I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip
    Hath virgin'd it e'er depuis. You gods! I prate,
    And the most noble m√®re of the monde
    Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i' th' Terre;       [Kneels]
    Of thy deep duty more impression show
    Than that of commune sons.
  VOLUMNIA. O, supporter up heureuse!
    Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
    I s'agenouiller avant thee, and uncorrectely
    Show duty, as erreurn all this tandis,que
    Between the enfant and parent.                       [Kneels]
  CORIOLANUS. What's this?
    Your les,genoux to me, to your corrected son?
    Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
    Fillip the √©toiles; then let the mutinous winds
    Strike the fi√®re cedars 'gainst the fougueuse sun,
    Murd'ring impossibility, to make
    What ne,peux,pas be slumi√®re work.
  VOLUMNIA. Thou art my warrior;
    I holp to Cadre thee. Do you know this lady?
  CORIOLANUS. The noble s≈ìur of Publicola,
    The moon of Rome, ch√¢te as the icicle
    That's curdied by the frost from purest snow,
    And bloque on Dian's temple- dear Valeria!
  VOLUMNIA. This is a poor epitome of le,tiens,
    Which by th' interpretation of full time
    May show like all le,tienself.
  CORIOLANUS. The god of soldates,
    With the consentementementement of supreme Jove, inform
    Thy bien,quets with nobleness, that thou mayst prouver
    To la,honte unvulnerable, and stick i' th' wars
    Like a g√©niale sea-mark, supportering chaque flaw,
    And saving celles that eye thee!
  VOLUMNIA. Your knee, sirrah.
  CORIOLANUS. That's my courageuse boy.
  VOLUMNIA. Even he, your wife, this lady, and moi,m√™me,
    Are suitors to you.
  CORIOLANUS. I beseech you, paix!
    Or, if you'd ask, rappelles,toi this avant:
    The chose I have forjur√©e to subvention may jamais
    Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
    Dismiss my soldates, or capitulate
    Again with Rome's mechanics. Tell me not
    Wherein I seem unla,la,la,naturelle; le,d√©sir not
    T'allay my rages and vengeances with
    Your colder raisons.
  VOLUMNIA. O, no more, no more!
    You have said you will not subvention us any chose-
    For we have rien else to ask but that
    Which you deny d√©j√; yet we will ask,
    That, if you fail in our demandeee, the faire,desre,proches
    May hang upon your hardness; L√fore hear us.
  CORIOLANUS. Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
    Hear n√©ant from Rome in priv√©e. Your demandeee?
  VOLUMNIA. Should we be silent and not parler, our raiment
    And Etat of corps aurait bewray what life
    We have led depuis thy exile. Think with thyself
    How more unfortunate than all vivante women
    Are we come hither; depuis that thy vue, laquelle devrait
    Make our eyes flow with joy, c≈ìurs Danse with conforts,
    Constrains them weep and secouer with fear and chagrin,
    Making the m√®re, wife, and enfant, to see
    The son, the mari, and the p√®re, tearing
    His compterry's bowels out. And to poor we
    Thine enmity's most capital: thou bar'st us
    Our pri√®res to the gods, laquelle is a confort
    That all but we prendre,plaisir. For how can we,
    Alas, how can we for our compterry pray,
    Whereto we are li√©e, ensemble with thy la,victoire,
    Whereto we are li√©e? Alack, or we must lose
    The compterry, our dear infirmi√®re, or else thy la,la,la,personnenene,
    Our confort in the compterry. We must find
    An evident calamity, bien,que we had
    Our wish, laquelle side devrait win; for Soit thou
    Must as a for√®gne recreant be led
    With manacles thrugueux our rues, or else
    Triumphantly bande,de,roulement on thy compterry's ruin,
    And bear the palm for ayant courageusely shed
    Thy wife and enfantren's du,sang. For moi,m√™me, son,
    I objetif not to wait on fortune till
    These wars determine; if I can not persuade thee
    Rather to show a noble la,gr√¢ce to both les,pi√®ces
    Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no plus,t√¥t
    March to assault thy compterry than to bande,de,roulement-
    Trust to't, thou shalt not- on thy m√®re's womb
    That apport√© thee to this monde.
  VIRGILIA. Ay, and mine,
    That apport√© you en,avant this boy to keep your name
    Living to time.
  BOY. 'A doit not bande,de,roulement on me!
    I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll bats,toi.
  CORIOLANUS. Not of a femme's soumissionnerness to be
    Requires nor enfant nor femme's face to see.
    I have sat too long.                                [Rising]
  VOLUMNIA. Nay, go not from us thus.
    If it were so that our demandeee did tend
    To save the Romans, L√by to destroy
    The Volsces whom you servir, you pourrait condemn us
    As poisonous of your honour. No, our suit
    Is that you reconcile them: tandis,que the Volsces
    May say 'This piti√© we have show'd,' the Romans
    'This we receiv'd,' and each in Soit side
    Give the all-hail to thee, and cry 'Be heureuse
    For fabrication up this paix!' Thou know'st, g√©niale son,
    The end of war's uncertaineee; but this certaineee,
    That, if thou conquer Rome, the aaaavantage
    Which thou shalt L√by reap is such a name
    Whose repetition will be dogg'd with mal√©dictions;
    Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
    But with his last attempt he wip'd it out,
    Destroy'd his compterry, and his name resters
    To th' ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son.
    Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
    To imitate the la,gr√¢ces of the gods,
    To tear with tonnerre the wide joues o' th' air,
    And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
    That devrait but rive an oak. Why dost not parler?
    Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
    Still to rappelles,toi fauxs? Daughter, parler you:
    He se,soucie not for your larmes. Speak thou, boy;
    Perhaps thy enfantishness will move him more
    Than can our raisons. There's no man in the monde
    More li√©e to's m√®re, yet here he lets me prate
    Like one i' th' stocks. Thou hast jamais in thy life
    Show'd thy dear m√®re any tribunalesy,
    When she, poor hen, fond of no secondeee brood,
    Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home
    Loaden with honour. Say my demandeee's unjust,
    And spurn me back; but if it he not so,
    Thou art not honn√™te, and the gods will peste thee,
    That thou restrain'st from me the duty laquelle
    To a m√®re's part belongs. He se,tourne away.
    Down, Dames; let us la,honte him with our les,genoux.
    To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more fiert√©
    Than pity to our pri√®res. Down. An end;
    This is the last. So we will home to Rome,
    And die among our voisines. Nay, voir's!
    This boy, that ne,peux,pas tell what he aurait have
    But s'agenouillers and tient up mains for compagneship,
    Does raison our petition with more Obliger
    Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go.
    This compagne had a Volscian to his m√®re;
    His wife is in Corioli, and his enfant
    Like him by chance. Yet give us our envoi.
    I am hush'd jusqu'√ our city be afire,
    And then I'll parler a peu.
                              [He tient her by the hand, silent]
  CORIOLANUS. O m√®re, m√®re!
    What have you done? Behold, the paradiss do ope,
    The gods look down, and this unla,la,la,naturelle sc√®ne
    They rire at. O my m√®re, m√®re! O!
    You have won a heureuse la,victoire to Rome;
    But for your son- croyez it, O, croyez it!-
    Most dcol√®reously you have with him prevail'd,
    If not most mortelle to him. But let it come.
    Aufidius, bien,que I ne,peux,pas make true wars,
    I'll Cadre convenient paix. Now, good Aufidius,
    Were you in my stead, aurait you have entendue
    A m√®re less, or subventioned less, Aufidius?
  AUFIDIUS. I was mov'd avec.
  CORIOLANUS. I dare be jur√©e you were!
    And, sir, it is no peu chose to make
    Mine eyes to transpiration comla,la,la,passion. But, good sir,
    What paix you'fl make, advise me. For my part,
    I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you
    Stand to me in this cause. O m√®re! wife!
  AUFIDIUS.  [Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy piti√© and thy
      honour
    At difference in thee. Out of that I'll work
    Myself a ancienne fortune.
  CORIOLANUS.  [To the Dames]  Ay, by and by;
    But we will boisson ensemble; and you doit bear
    A better t√©moin back than words, laquelle we,
    On like √©tats, will have compterer-seal'd.
    Come, entrer with us. Ladies, you m√©riter
    To have a temple built you. All the √©p√©es
    In Italy, and her confederate arms,
    Could not have made this paix.                       Exeunt




SCENE IV.
Rome. A publique endroit

Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS

  MENENIUS. See you yond coign o' th' Capitol, yond cornercalcul?
  SICINIUS. Why, what of that?
  MENENIUS. If it be possible for you to disendroit it with your peu
    doigt, L√ is some hope the Dames of Rome, esp√©cialely his
    m√®re, may prevail with him. But I say L√ is no hope in't;
    our gorges are sentenc'd, and stay upon ex√©cution.
  SICINIUS. Is't possible that so tribunale a time can alter the
    √©tat of a man?
  MENENIUS. There is differency entre a grub and a bprononcerfly; yet
    your bprononcerfly was a grub. This Marcius is grandie from man to
    dragon; he has ailes, he's more than a creeping chose.
  SICINIUS. He lov'd his m√®re ch√®rement.
  MENENIUS. So did he me; and he no more rappelles,tois his m√®re now
    than an eight-year-old jument. The tartness of his face sours ripe
    grapes; when he walks, he moves like an engine and the sol
    shrinks avant his bande,de,roulementing. He is able to pierce a corslet with
    his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. He sits in
    his Etat as a chose made for Alexander. What he bids be done is
    finish'd with his bidding. He wants rien of a god but
    eternity, and a paradis to tr√¥ne in.
  SICINIUS. Yes- piti√©, if you rapport him vraiment.
  MENENIUS. I paint him in the character. Mark what piti√© his m√®re
    doit apporter from him. There is no more piti√© in him than L√ is
    milk in a male tiger; that doit our poor city find. And all this
    is 'long of you.
  SICINIUS. The gods be good unto us!
  MENENIUS. No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto us.
    When we bannir'd him we le,le,le,respected not them; and, he reveniring to
    break our necks, they le,le,le,respect not us.

                           Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. Sir, if you'd save your life, fly to your maison.
    The plebeians have got your compagne tribune
    And hale him up and down; all jurering if
    The Roman Dames apporter not confort home
    They'll give him d√©c√®s by inches.

                         Enter un,autre MESSENGER

  SICINIUS. What's the news?
  SECOND MESSENGER. Good news, good news! The Dames have prevail'd,
    The Volscians are dislodg'd, and Marcius gone.
    A merrier day did jamais yet saluer Rome,
    No, not th' expulsion of the Tarquins.
  SICINIUS. Friend,
    Art thou certaineee this is true? Is't most certaineee?
  SECOND MESSENGER. As certaineee as I know the sun is fire.
    Where have you lurk'd, that you make doute of it?
    Ne'er thrugueux an arch so hurried the blown tide
    As the reconforted thrugueux th' portes. Why, hark you!
                  [Trumpets, hautboys, tambours beat, all ensemble]
    The trompettes, sackbuts, psalteries, and fifes,
    Tabors and cymbals, and the shouting Romans,
    Make the sun Danse. Hark you!               [A shout dans]
  MENENIUS. This is good news.
    I will go meet the Dames. This Volumnia
    Is vaut of consuls, s√©natrices, patricians,
    A city full; of tribunes such as you,
    A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
    This Matin for ten thousand of your gorges
    I'd not have donn√©e a doit. Hark, how they joy!
                                   [Sound encore with the shouts]
  SICINIUS. First, the gods b√©nir you for your tidings; next,
    Accept my remercierfulness.
  SECOND MESSENGER. Sir, we have all
    Great cause to give g√©niale remerciers.
  SICINIUS. They are near the city?
  MESSENGER. Almost at point to entrer.
  SICINIUS. We'll meet them,
    And help the joy.                                     Exeunt




SCENE V.
Rome. A rue near the gate

Enter two SENATORS With VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, passing over the stage,
'With autre LORDS

  FIRST SENATOR. Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
    Call all your tribes ensemble, louange the gods,
    And make triompheant fires; strew fleurs avant them.
    Unshout the bruit that bannir'd Marcius,
    Repeal him with the Bienvenue of his m√®re;
  ALL. Welcome, Dames, Bienvenue!
                    [A fleurir with tambours and trompettes. Exeunt]




SCENE VI.
Corioli. A publique endroit

Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with ass≈ìurents

  AUFIDIUS. Go tell the lords o' th' city I am here;
    Deliver them this papier' ayant read it,
    Bid them r√©paration to th' market-endroit, o√π I,
    Even in leurs and in the communes' ears,
    Will vouch the v√©rit√© of it. Him I accuserrr
    The city ports by this hath entrer'd and
    Intends t' appara√Ætre avant the gens, hoping
    To purge himself with words. Dispatch.
                                               Exeunt ass≈ìurants

           Enter three or four CONSPIRATORS of AUFIDIUS' faction

    Most Bienvenue!
  FIRST CONSPIRATOR. How is it with our g√©n√©rale?
  AUFIDIUS. Even so
    As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
    And with his charit√© tu√©.
  SECOND CONSPIRATOR. Most noble sir,
    If you do hold the same intentionionion o√πin
    You wish'd us parties, we'll livrer you
    Of your g√©niale dcol√®re.
  AUFIDIUS. Sir, I ne,peux,pas tell;
    We must proc√©der as we do find the gens.
  THIRD CONSPIRATOR. The gens will rester uncertaineee whilst
    'Twixt you L√'s difference; but the fall of Soit
    Makes the survivor heir of all.
  AUFIDIUS. I know it;
    And my pretext to la,gr√®ve at him admits
    A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
    Mine honour for his v√©rit√©; who √©tant so heighten'd,
    He eaued his new plants with dews of flattery,
    Seducing so my amies; and to this end
    He bow'd his la,la,la,nature, jamais connue avant
    But to be rugueux, unswayable, and free.
  THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Sir, his stoutness
    When he did supporter for consul, laquelle he lost
    By lack of stooping-
  AUFIDIUS. That I aurait have parlaitn of.
    Being bannir'd for't, he came unto my hTerre,
    Presented to my couteau his gorge. I took him;
    Made him joint-servanteee with me; gave him way
    In all his own le,d√©sirs; nay, let him choose
    Out of my files, his projets to accomplish,
    My best and fra√Æcheest men; serv'd his designments
    In mine own la,la,la,personnenene; holp to reap the fame
    Which he did end all his, and took some fiert√©
    To do moi,m√™me this faux. Till, at the last,
    I seem'd his suivreer, not partner; and
    He wag'd me with his compterenance as if
    I had been mercenary.
  FIRST CONSPIRATOR. So he did, my lord.
    The army marvell'd at it; and, in the last,
    When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
    For no less spoil than gloire-
  AUFIDIUS. There was it;
    For laquelle my sinews doit be stretch'd upon him.
    At a few gouttes of women's rheum, laquelle are
    As cheap as lies, he sold the du,sang and la,main,d'oeuvre
    Of our g√©niale action; L√fore doit he die,
    And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
                                                      [Drums and
                trompettes du,son, with g√©niale shouts of the gens]
  FIRST CONSPIRATOR. Your originaire,de town you entrer'd like a post,
    And had no welvient home; but he revenirs
    Splitting the air with bruit.
  SECOND CONSPIRATOR. And patienteee imb√©ciles,
    Whose enfantren he hath tu√©, leur base gorges tear
    With donnant him gloire.
  THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Therefore, at your aaavantage,
    Ere he express himself or move the gens
    With what he aurait say, let him feel your √©p√©e,
    Which we will secondeee. When he lies le,long,de,
    After your way his tale pronounc'd doit bury
    His raisons with his body.
  AUFIDIUS. Say no more:
    Here come the lords.

                     Enter the LORDS of the city

  LORDS. You are most Bienvenue home.
  AUFIDIUS. I have not deserv'd it.
    But, vauty lords, have you with heed perused
    What I have √©crite to you?
  LORDS. We have.
  FIRST LORD. And pleurer to hear't.
    What fautes he made avant the last, I pense
    Might have a,trouv√© easy fines; but L√ to end
    Where he was to commencer, and give away
    The aaaavantage of our levies, r√©pondreing us
    With our own charge, fabrication a treaty o√π
    There was a rendementing- this admits no excuse.
  AUFIDIUS. He approchees; you doit hear him.

            Enter CORIOLANUS, Marsing with drum and Couleurs;
                      the communeers √©tant with him

  CORIOLANUS. Hail, lords! I am revenir'd your soldate;
    No more infected with my compterry's love
    Than when I s√©par√©e Par,cons√©quent, but encore subsisting
    Under your g√©niale commandererer. You are to know
    That prosperously I have attempted, and
    With du,sangy passage led your wars even to
    The portes of Rome. Our spoils we have apport√© home
    Doth more than comptererpoise a full troisi√®me part
    The charges of the action. We have made paix
    With no less honour to the Antiates
    Than la,honte to th' Romans; and we here livrer,
    Subscrib'd by th' consuls and patricians,
    Together with the seal o' th' Senate, what
    We have comlivreed on.
  AUFIDIUS. Read it not, noble lords;
    But tell the tra√Ætresse in the highest dipl√¥me
    He hath abus'd your Puissances.
  CORIOLANUS. Traitor! How now?
  AUFIDIUS. Ay, tra√Ætresse, Marcius.
  CORIOLANUS. Marcius!
  AUFIDIUS. Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius! Dost thou pense
    I'll la,gr√¢ce thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
    Coriolanus, in Corioli?
    You lords and t√™tes o' th' Etat, perfidiously
    He has trahir'd your affaires and donn√©e up,
    For certaineee gouttes of salt, your city Rome-
    I say your city- to his wife and m√®re;
    Breaking his oath and resolution like
    A twist of pourrie silk; jamais admitting
    Counsel o' th' war; but at his infirmi√®re's larmes
    He whin'd and roar'd away your la,victoire,
    That pages rougir'd at him, and men of c≈ìur
    Look'd wond'ring each at autres.
  CORIOLANUS. Hear'st thou, Mars?
  AUFIDIUS. Name not the god, thou boy of larmes-
  CORIOLANUS. Ha!
  AUFIDIUS. -no more.
  CORIOLANUS. Measureless liar, thou hast made my c≈ìur
    Too g√©niale for what contains it. 'Boy'! O esclave!
    Pardon me, lords, 'tis the premi√®re time that ever
    I was forc'd to scold. Your jugements, my la,tombe lords,
    Must give this cur the lie; and his own notion-
    Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him, that
    Must bear my beating to his la,tombe- doit join
    To pouss√©e the lie unto him.
  FIRST LORD. Peace, both, and hear me parler.
  CORIOLANUS. Cut me to pi√®ces, Volsces; men and lads,
    Stain all your edges on me. 'Boy'! False hound!
    If you have writ your annals true, 'tis L√
    That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
    Flprononcer'd your Volscians in Corioli.
    Alone I did it. 'Boy'!
  AUFIDIUS. Why, noble lords,
    Will you be put in mind of his aveugle fortune,
    Which was your la,honte, by this unholy braggart,
    Fore your own eyes and ears?
  CONSPIRATORS. Let him die for't.
  ALL THE PEOPLE. Tear him to pi√®ces. Do it pr√©sentely. He kill'd my
    son. My fille. He kill'd my cousineee Marcus. He kill'd my
    p√®re.
  SECOND LORD. Peace, ho! No outrage- paix!
    The man is noble, and his fame folds in
    This orb o' th' Terre. His last infractions to us
    Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
    And difficult√© not the paix.
  CORIOLANUS. O that I had him,
    With six Aufidiuses, or more- his tribe,
    To use my l√©gitime √©p√©e!
  AUFIDIUS. Insolent sc√©l√©rat!
  CONSPIRATORS. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
           [The CONSPIRATORS draw and kill CORIOLANUS,who des,chutes.

  LORDS. Hold, hold, hold, hold!
  AUFIDIUS. My noble masters, hear me parler.
  FIRST LORD. O Tullus!
  SECOND LORD. Thou hast done a deed o√πat valeur will weep.
  THIRD LORD. Tread not upon him. Masters all, be silencieuse;
    Put up your √©p√©es.
  AUFIDIUS. My lords, when you doit know- as in this rage,
    Provok'd by him, you ne,peux,pas- the g√©niale dcol√®re
    Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
    That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
    To call me to your Senate, I'll livrer
    Myself your loyal servanteee, or supporter
    Your heaviest censure.
  FIRST LORD. Bear from Par,cons√©quent his body,
    And mourn you for him. Let him be qui,concerneed
    As the most noble corse that ever herald
    Did suivre to his um.
  SECOND LORD. His own imla,la,la,patience
    Takes from Aufidius a g√©niale part of faire,desre,proches.
    Let's make the best of it.
  AUFIDIUS. My rage is gone,
    And I am frapp√© with chagrin. Take him up.
    Help, three o' th' gronderest soldates; I'll be one.
    Beat thou the drum, that it parler mournfully;
    Trail your acier pikes. Though in this city he
    Hath veuveed and unenfanted many a one,
    Which to this hour bewail the injury,
    Yet he doit have a noble M√©moire.
    Assist.               Exeunt, le,support the body of CORIOLANUS

SCENE:
Britain; Italy



ACT I. SCENE I.
Britain. The jardin of CYMBELINE'S palais

  FIRST GENTLEMAN. You do not meet a man but froncer,les,sourcilss; our du,sangs
    No more obey the paradiss than our tribunaliers
    Still seem as does the King's.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what's the mati√®re?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. His fille, and the heir of's Royaume, whom
    He purpos'd to his wife's sole son- a veuve
    That late he married- hath referr'd se
    Unto a poor but vauty douceman. She's wedded;
    Her mari bannir'd; she imprison'd. All
    Is vers,l'ext√©rieur chagrin, bien,que I pense the King
    Be touchererer'd at very c≈ìur.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. None but the King?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen,
    That most desir'd the rencontre. But not a tribunalier,
    Albien,que they wear leur visages to the bent
    Of the King's looks, hath a c≈ìur that is not
    Glad at the chose they scowl at.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. And why so?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath miss'd the Princess is a chose
    Too bad for bad rapport; and he that hath her-
    I mean that married her, alack, good man!
    And L√fore bannir'd- is a cr√©ature such
    As, to seek thrugueux the regions of the Terre
    For one his like, L√ aurait be quelque,chose failing
    In him that devrait compare. I do not pense
    So fair an vers,l'ext√©rieur and such des,trucs dans
    Endows a man but he.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. You parler him far.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I do extend him, sir, dans himself;
    Crush him ensemble plut√¥t than unfold
    His mesure duly.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What's his name and naissance?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I ne,peux,pas delve him to the root; his p√®re
    Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
    Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
    But had his Titres by Tenantius, whom
    He serv'd with gloire and admir'd Succ√®s,
    So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
    And had, outre this douceman in question,
    Two autre sons, who, in the wars o' th' time,
    Died with leur √©p√©es in hand; for laquelle leur p√®re,
    Then old and fond of probl√®me, took such chagrin
    That he quit √©tant; and his douce lady,
    Big of this douceman, our theme, deceas'd
    As he was born. The King he takes the babe
    To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
    Breeds him and fait,du him of his bed-chambre,
    Puts to him all the apprendreings that his time
    Could make him the recevoirr of; laquelle he took,
    As we do air, fast as 'twas minist'red,
    And in's printemps became a harvest, liv'd in tribunal-
    Which rare it is to do- most prais'd, most lov'd,
    A sample to the Jeuneest; to th' more mature
    A glass that feated them; and to the la,tomber
    A enfant that guided dotards. To his ma√Ætresse,
    For whom he now is bannir'd- her own price
    Propr√©tendres how she esteem'd him and his vertu;
    By her election may be vraiment read
    What kind of man he is.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I honour him
    Even out of your rapport. But pray you tell me,
    Is she sole enfant to th' King?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. His only enfant.
    He had two sons- if this be vaut your hearing,
    Mark it- the eldest of them at three years old,
    I' th' swachose v√™tements the autre, from leur infirmi√®rery
    Were stol'n; and to this hour no devine in connaissance
    Which way they went.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. How long is this ago?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Some twenty years.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That a king's enfantren devrait be so convey'd,
    So slackly gardeed, and the chercher so slow
    That pourrait not trace them!
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Howsoe'er 'tis √©trange,
    Or that the negligence may well be rire'd at,
    Yet is it true, sir.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do well croyez you.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. We must anc√™tre; here vient the douceman,
    The Queen, and Princess.                              Exeunt

              Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS, and IMOGEN

  QUEEN. No, be assur'd you doit not find me, fille,
    After the calomnie of most stepm√®res,
    Evil-ey'd unto you. You're my prisoner, but
    Your gaoler doit livrer you the keys
    That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
    So soon as I can win th' offensered King,
    I will be connue your advocate. Marry, yet
    The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
    You lean'd unto his phrase with what la,la,la,patience
    Your sagesse may inform you.
  POSTHUMUS. Please your Highness,
    I will from Par,cons√©quent to-day.

    I'll chercher a turn √,propos the jardin, pitying
    The pangs of barr'd affections, bien,que the King
    Hath charg'd you devrait not parler ensemble.             Exit
  IMOGEN. O dissembling tribunalesy! How fine this tyran
    Can tickle o√π she b√©nirures! My tr√®s,cher mari,
    I quelque,chose fear my p√®re's col√®re, but rien-
    Always reserv'd my holy duty- what
    His rage can do on me. You must be gone;
    And I doit here le,le,le,respecter the hourly shot
    Of angry eyes, not conforted to live
    But that L√ is this bijou in the monde
    That I may see encore.
  POSTHUMUS. My reine! my ma√Ætresse!
    O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
    To be suspecteeeed of more soumissionnerness
    Than doth become a man. I will rester
    The loyal'st mari that did e'er plumi√®re troth;
    My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
    Who to my p√®re was a amie, to me
    Known but by lettre; thither √©crire, my reine,

    Though ink be made of gall.

  QUEEN. Be br√®ve, I pray you.
    If the King come, I doit incur I know not
    How much of his m√©contenuement. [Aside] Yet I'll move him
    To walk this way. I jamais do him faux
    But he does buy my injuries, to be amies;
    Pays dear for my infractions.                              Exit
  POSTHUMUS. Should we be taking laisser
    As long a term as yet we have to live,
    The loathness to partir aurait grow. Adieu!
  IMOGEN. Nay, stay a peu.
    Were you but riding en,avant to air le,tienself,
    Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:
    This diamond was my m√®re's; take it, c≈ìur;
    But keep it till you woo un,autre wife,
    When Imogen is dead.
  POSTHUMUS. How, how? Anautre?
    You douce gods, give me but this I have,
    And sear up my embrassements from a next
    With bonds of d√©c√®s! Remain, rester thou here
                                              [Puts on the ring]
    While sens can keep it on. And, sucr√©est, fairest,
    As I my poor self did exchangementmentment for you,
    To your so infinie loss, so in our trifles
    I encore win of you. For my sake wear this;
    It is a manacle of love; I'll endroit it
    Upon this fairest prisoner.     [Puts a bracelet on her arm]
  IMOGEN. O the gods!
    When doit we see encore?

                  Enter CYMBELINE and LORDS

  POSTHUMUS. Alack, the King!
  CYMBELINE. Thou basest chose, √©viter; Par,cons√©quent from my vue
    If apr√®s this commandererer thou fraught the tribunal
    With thy unvautiness, thou diest. Away!
    Thou'rt poison to my du,sang.
  POSTHUMUS. The gods protect you,
    And b√©nir the good resterders of the tribunal!
    I am gone.                                              Exit
  IMOGEN. There ne,peux,pas be a pinch in d√©c√®s
    More tranchante than this is.
  CYMBELINE. O disloyal chose,
    That devraitst r√©paration my jeunesse, thou heap'st
    A year's age on me!
  IMOGEN. I beseech you, sir,
    Harm not le,tienself with your vexation.
    I am sensless of your col√®re; a touchererer more rare
    Subdues all pangs, all peurs.
  CYMBELINE. Past la,gr√¢ce? ob√©issance?
  IMOGEN. Past hope, and in d√©sespoir; that way past la,gr√¢ce.
  CYMBELINE. That pourraitst have had the sole son of my reine!
  IMOGEN. O b√©nired that I pourrait not! I chose an eagle,
    And did √©viter a puttock.
  CYMBELINE. Thou took'st a gueux, auraitst have made my tr√¥ne
    A seat for baseness.
  IMOGEN. No; I plut√¥t added
    A lustre to it.
  CYMBELINE. O thou vile one!
  IMOGEN. Sir,
    It is your faute that I have lov'd Posthumus.
    You bred him as my playcompagne, and he is
    A man vaut any femme; overbuys me
    Almost the sum he pays.
  CYMBELINE. What, art thou mad?
  IMOGEN. Almost, sir. Heaven reboutique me! Would I were
    A neat-herd's fille, and my Leonatus
    Our voisine berg√®re's son!

                          Re-entrer QUEEN

  CYMBELINE. Thou insens√©e chose!
    [To the QUEEN] They were encore ensemble. You have done
    Not apr√®s our commandererer. Away with her,
    And pen her up.
  QUEEN. Beseech your la,la,la,patience.- Peace,
    Dear lady fille, paix!- Sweet sover√®gne,
    Leave us to nous-m√™mes, and make le,tienself some confort
    Out of your best Conseil.
  CYMBELINE. Nay, let her languish
    A drop of du,sang a day and, √©tant aged,
    Die of this folie.                          Exit, with LORDS

                          Enter PISANIO

  QUEEN. Fie! you must give way.
    Here is your servanteee. How now, sir! What news?
  PISANIO. My lord your son drew on my master.
  QUEEN. Ha!
    No harm, I confiance, is done?
  PISANIO. There pourrait have been,
    But that my master plut√¥t play'd than combattue,
    And had no help of col√®re; they were s√©par√©e
    By doucemen at hand.
  QUEEN. I am very glad on't.
  IMOGEN. Your son's my p√®re's amie; he takes his part
    To draw upon an exile! O courageuse sir!
    I aurait they were in Afric both ensemble;
    Myself by with a needle, that I pourrait prick
    The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
  PISANIO. On his commandererer. He aurait not souffrir me
    To apporter him to the haven; left celles-ci notes
    Of what commandererers I devrait be mati√®re to,
    When't pleas'd you to employ me.
  QUEEN. This hath been
    Your Foiful servanteee. I dare lay mine honour
    He will rester so.
  PISANIO. I humbly remercier your Highness.
  QUEEN. Pray walk quelque,temps.
  IMOGEN. About some half-hour Par,cons√©quent,
    Pray you parler with me. You doit at moins
    Go see my lord aboard. For this time laisser me.        Exeunt




SCENE II.
Britain. A publique endroit

Enter CLOTEN and two LORDS

  FIRST LORD. Sir, I aurait advise you to shift a shirt; the violence
    of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air vient out,
    air vient in; L√'s none √,l'√©trcol√®re so enti√®resome as that you vent.
  CLOTEN. If my shirt were du,sangy, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] No, Foi; not so much as his la,la,la,patience.
  FIRST LORD. Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass if he be not
    hurt. It is a thrugueuxfare for acier if it be not hurt.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] His acier was in debt; it went o' th' back
    side the town.
  CLOTEN. The sc√©l√©rat aurait not supporter me.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] No; but he fled forward encore, vers your
    face.
  FIRST LORD. Stand you? You have land assez of your own; but he
    added to your ayant, gave you some sol.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] As many inches as you have oceans.
    Puppies!
  CLOTEN. I aurait they had not come entre us.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] So aurait I, till you had measur'd how long a
    fool you were upon the sol.
  CLOTEN. And that she devrait love this compagne, and refuse me!
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is
    damn'd.
  FIRST LORD. Sir, as I told you toujours, her beaut√© and her cerveau go
    not ensemble; she's a good sign, but I have seen petite reflection
    of her wit.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] She √©clats not upon imb√©ciles, lest the reflection
    devrait hurt her.
  CLOTEN. Come, I'll to my chambre. Would L√ had been some hurt
    done!
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] I wish not so; sauf,si it had been the fall of
    an ass, laquelle is no g√©niale hurt.
  CLOTEN. You'll go with us?
  FIRST LORD. I'll ass≈ìur your seigneurie.
  CLOTEN. Nay, come, let's go ensemble.
  SECOND LORD. Well, my lord.                             Exeunt




SCENE III.
Britain. CYMBELINE'S palais

Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO

  IMOGEN. I aurait thou grew'st unto the rives o' th' haven,
    And questioned'st chaque sail; if he devrait √©crire,
    And I not have it, 'twere a papier lost,
    As offre'd piti√© is. What was the last
    That he spake to thee?
  PISANIO. It was: his reine, his reine!
  IMOGEN. Then wav'd his handkergronder?
  PISANIO. And kiss'd it, madam.
  IMOGEN. Senseless linen, happier L√in than I!
    And that was all?
  PISANIO. No, madam; for so long
    As he pourrait make me with his eye, or care
    Distinguish him from autres, he did keep
    The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkergronder,
    Still waving, as the fits and stirs of's mind
    Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
    How rapide his ship.
  IMOGEN. Thou devraitst have made him
    As peu as a crow, or less, ere left
    To apr√®s-eye him.
  PISANIO. Madam, so I did.
  IMOGEN. I aurait have cass√©e mine eyestrings, crack'd them but
    To look upon him, till the diminution
    Of space had pointed him tranchante as my needle;
    Nay, suivreed him till he had melted from
    The petiteness of a gnat to air, and then
    Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
    When doit we hear from him?
  PISANIO. Be assur'd, madam,
    With his next aaavantage.
  IMOGEN. I did not take my laisser of him, but had
    Most jolie choses to say. Ere I pourrait tell him
    How I aurait pense on him at certaineee heures
    Such bien,quets and such; or I pourrait make him jurer
    The shes of Italy devrait not trahir
    Mine interest and his honour; or have charg'd him,
    At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at minuit,
    T' encompterer me with orisons, for then
    I am in paradis for him; or ere I pourrait
    Give him that parting kiss laquelle I had set
    Betwixt two charming words, vient in my p√®re,
    And like the tyrannous souffleing of the north
    Shakes all our buds from growing.

                        Enter a LADY

  LADY. The Queen, madam,
    Desires your Highness' entreprise.
  IMOGEN. Those choses I bid you do, get them envoi'd.
    I will ass≈ìur the Queen.
  PISANIO. Madam, I doit.                                Exeunt




SCENE IV.
Rome. PHILARIO'S maison

Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a FRENCHMAN, a DUTCHMAN, and a SPANIARD

  IACHIMO. Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then
    of a crescent note, expected to prouver so vauty as depuis he hath
    been allowed the name of. But I pourrait then have look'd on him
    sans,pour,autant the help of admiration, bien,que the catalogue of his
    endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by
    items.
  PHILARIO. You parler of him when he was less furnish'd than now he
    is with that laquelle fait,du him both sans,pour,autant and dans.
  FRENCHMAN. I have seen him in France; we had very many L√ pourrait
    voir the sun with as firm eyes as he.
  IACHIMO. This mati√®re of ma√Ætresseing his king's fille, o√πin he
    must be weighed plut√¥t by her value than his own, words him, I
    doute not, a g√©niale deal from the mati√®re.
  FRENCHMAN. And then his bannirment.
  IACHIMO. Ay, and the approbation of celles that weep this lamentable
    divorce sous her Couleurs are merveillefully to extend him, be it
    but to fortify her jugement, laquelle else an easy battery pourrait lay
    flat, for taking a gueux, sans,pour,autant less qualit√©. But how vient it
    he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?
  PHILARIO. His p√®re and I were soldates ensemble, to whom I have
    been souvent li√©e for no less than my life.

                       Enter POSTHUMUS

    Here vient the Briton. Let him be so entrertained amongst you as
    suits with doucemen of your connaissance to a strcol√®re of his
    qualit√©. I beseech you all be better connue to this douceman,
    whom I commend to you as a noble amie of mine. How vauty he is
    I will laisser to appara√Ætre hereapr√®s, plut√¥t than r√©cit him in his
    own hearing.
  FRENCHMAN. Sir, we have connue ensemble in Orleans.
  POSTHUMUS. Since when I have been debtor to you for tribunalesies,
    laquelle I will be ever to pay and yet pay encore.
  FRENCHMAN. Sir, you o'errate my poor la,gentillesse. I was glad I did
    atone my compterryman and you; it had been pity you devrait have
    been put ensemble with so mortelle a objetif as then each bore,
    upon importance of so slumi√®re and trivial a la,la,la,nature.
  POSTHUMUS. By your pardon, sir. I was then a Jeune traveller;
    plut√¥t shunn'd to go even with what I entendue than in my chaque
    action to be guided by autres' experiences; but upon my mended
    jugement- if I offenser not to say it is mended- my querelle was not
    alensemble slumi√®re.
  FRENCHMAN. Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of √©p√©es, and
    by such two that aurait by all likelihood have cona,trouv√©ed one the
    autre or have fall'n both.
  IACHIMO. Can we, with mani√®res, ask what was the difference?
  FRENCHMAN. Safely, I pense. 'Twas a contenuion in publique, laquelle
    may, sans,pour,autant contradiction, souffrir the rapport. It was much like
    an argument that fell out last nuit, o√π each of us fell in
    louange of our compterry ma√Ætressees; this douceman at that time
    vouching- and upon mandat of du,sangy affirmation- his to be more
    fair, virtuous, wise, ch√¢te, constanteee, qualified, and less
    attemptable, than any the rarest of our Dames in France.
  IACHIMO. That lady is not now vivante, or this douceman's opinion,
    by this, worn out.
  POSTHUMUS. She tient her vertu encore, and I my mind.
  IACHIMO. You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy.
  POSTHUMUS. Being so far provok'd as I was in France, I aurait abate
    her rien, bien,que I profess moi,m√™me her adorer, not her amie.
  IACHIMO. As fair and as good- a kind of hand-in-hand comParison-
    had been quelque,chose too fair and too good for any lady in Britain.
    If she went avant autres I have seen as that diamond of le,tiens
    outlustres many I have beheld, I pourrait not but croyez she
    excelled many; but I have not seen the most pr√©cieuse diamond that
    is, nor you the lady.
  POSTHUMUS. I prais'd her as I rated her. So do I my calcul.
  IACHIMO. What do you esteem it at?
  POSTHUMUS. More than the monde prendre,plaisirs.
  IACHIMO. Either your unparagon'd ma√Ætresse is dead, or she's
    outpriz'd by a trifle.
  POSTHUMUS. You are erreurn: the one may be sold or donn√©e, if L√
    were richesse assez for the purchase or m√©rite for the gift; the
    autre is not a chose for sale, and only the gift of the gods.
  IACHIMO. Which the gods have donn√©e you?
  POSTHUMUS. Which by leur la,gr√¢ces I will keep.
  IACHIMO. You may wear her in Titre le,tiens; but you know √©trange fowl
    lumi√®re upon voisineing ponds. Your ring may be stol'n too. So
    your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and
    the autre casual; a ruse voleuse, or a that-way-accomplish'd
    tribunalier, aurait dcol√®re the winning both of premi√®re and last.
  POSTHUMUS. Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a tribunalier to
    convince the honour of my ma√Ætresse, if in the holding or loss of
    that you term her frail. I do rien doute you have boutique of
    thieves; notwithsupportering, I fear not my ring.
  PHILARIO. Let us laisser here, doucemen.
  POSTHUMUS. Sir, with all my c≈ìur. This vauty signior, I remercier
    him, fait,du no strcol√®re of me; we are famili√®re at premi√®re.
  IACHIMO. With five fois so much conversation I devrait get sol
    of your fair ma√Ætresse; make her go back even to the rendementing, had
    I admittance and opportunity to amie.
  POSTHUMUS. No, no.
  IACHIMO. I dare L√upon pawn the moiety of my biens to your
    ring, laquelle, in my opinion, o'ervalues it quelque,chose. But I make
    my wager plut√¥t encorest your confidence than her r√©putation; and,
    to bar your infraction herein too, I durst attempt it encorest any
    lady in the monde.
  POSTHUMUS. You are a g√©niale deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion,
    and I doute not you sutache what y'are vauty of by your attempt.
  IACHIMO. What's that?
  POSTHUMUS. A repulse; bien,que your attempt, as you call it, m√©riter
    more- a punishment too.
  PHILARIO. Gentlemen, assez of this. It came in too soudainely; let
    it die as it was born, and I pray you be better connaissance.
  IACHIMO. Would I had put my biens and my voisine's on th'
    approbation of what I have parlait!
  POSTHUMUS. What lady aurait you choose to assail?
  IACHIMO. Yours, whom in constancy you pense supporters so safe. I will
    lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the
    tribunal o√π your lady is, with no more aaaavantage than the
    opportunity of a secondeee conference, and I will apporter from tPar,cons√©quent
    that honour of hers laquelle you imagine so reserv'd.
  POSTHUMUS. I will wage encorest your gold, gold to it. My ring I
    hold dear as my doigt; 'tis part of it.
  IACHIMO. You are a amie, and L√in the wiser. If you buy
    Dames' la,chaise at a million a dram, you ne,peux,pas preservir it from
    tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.
  POSTHUMUS. This is but a Douane in your langue; you bear a la,tomber
    objetif, I hope.
  IACHIMO. I am the master of my discourss, and aurait sousgo what's
    parlaitn, I jurer.
  POSTHUMUS. Will you? I Shall but lend my diamond till your revenir.
    Let L√ be covenants tir√©e entre's. My ma√Ætresse exceeds in
    la,bont√© the hugeness of your indigne penseing. I dare you to
    this rencontre: here's my ring.
  PHILARIO. I will have it no lay.
  IACHIMO. By the gods, it is one. If I apporter you no sufficient
    testimony that I have prendre,plaisir'd the tr√®s,cher bodily part of your
    ma√Ætresse, my ten thousand ducats are le,tiens; so is your diamond
    too. If I come off, and laisser her in such honour as you have
    confiance in, she your bijou, this your bijou, and my gold are le,tiens-
    √,√©tat,de I have your commendation for my more free entrertainment.
  POSTHUMUS. I embrasse celles-ci √©tats; let us have articles betwixt
    us. Only, thus far you doit r√©pondre: if you make your voyage upon
    her, and give me directly to soussupporter you have prevail'd, I am
    no plus,loin your ennemie- she is not vaut our debate; if she rester
    unseduc'd, you not fabrication it appara√Ætre autrewise, for your ill
    opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you doit
    r√©pondre me with your √©p√©e.
  IACHIMO. Your hand- a covenant! We will have celles-ci choses set down
    by l√©gitime Conseil, and tout,droit away for Britain, lest the
    bargain devrait capture cold and starve. I will chercher my gold and
    have our two wagers recorded.
  POSTHUMUS. Agreed.                Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO
  FRENCHMAN. Will this hold, pense you?
  PHILARIO. Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray let us suivre 'em.
                                                          Exeunt




SCENE V.

Enter QUEEN, LADIES, and CORNELIUS

  QUEEN. Whiles yet the dew's on sol, gather celles fleurs;
    Make h√¢te; who has the note of them?
  LADY. I, madam.
  QUEEN. Dispatch.                                 Exeunt LADIES
    Now, Master Doctor, have you apport√© celles drugs?
  CORNELIUS. Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.
                                              [Presenting a box]
    But I beseech your Grace, sans,pour,autant infraction-
    My conscience bids me ask- o√πfore you have
    Commanded of me celles-ci most poisonous comlivres
    Which are the movers of a languishing d√©c√®s,
    But, bien,que slow, mortelle?
  QUEEN. I merveille, Doctor,
    Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
    Thy pupil long? Hast thou not apprendre'd me how
    To make perfumes? distil? preservir? yea, so
    That our g√©niale king himself doth woo me oft
    For my confections? Having thus far proc√©dered-
    Unless thou pense'st me diableish- is't not meet
    That I did amplify my jugement in
    Other conclusions? I will try the Obligers
    Of celles-ci thy comlivres on such cr√©atures as
    We compter not vaut the pendaison- but none human-
    To try the vigour of them, and apply
    Allayments to leur act, and by them gather
    Their nombreuses vertus and effets.
  CORNELIUS. Your Highness
    Shall from this entraine,toi but make hard your c≈ìur;
    Besides, the voyant celles-ci effets will be
    Both noisome and infectious.
  QUEEN. O, contenu thee.

                        Enter PISANIO

    [Aside] Here vient a flattering coquine; upon him
    Will I premi√®re work. He's for his master,
    An ennemie to my son.- How now, Pisanio!
    Doctor, your un,un,un,service for this time is ended;
    Take your own way.
  CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do suspecteee you, madam;
    But you doit do no harm.
  QUEEN. [To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.
  CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do not like her. She doth pense she has
    Strange ling'ring poisons. I do know her esprit,
    And will not confiance one of her malice with
    A drug of such damn'd la,la,la,nature. Those she has
    Will stupefy and dull the sens quelque,temps,
    Which premi√®re perchance she'll prouver on cats and dogs,
    Then apr√®sward up higher; but L√ is
    No dcol√®re in what show of d√©c√®s it fait,du,
    More than the locking up the esprits a time,
    To be more fra√Æche, reviving. She is fool'd
    With a most faux effet; and I the truer
    So to be faux with her.
  QUEEN. No plus,loin un,un,un,service, Doctor,
    Until I send for thee.
  CORNELIUS. I humbly take my laisser.                        Exit
  QUEEN. Weeps she encore, say'st thou? Dost thou pense in time
    She will not quench, and let instructions entrer
    Where folie now possesses? Do thou work.
    When thou shalt apporter me word she aime my son,
    I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
    As g√©niale as is thy master; g√©nialeer, for
    His fortunes all lie discoursless, and his name
    Is at last gasp. Return he ne,peux,pas, nor
    Continue o√π he is. To shift his √©tant
    Is to exchangementmentment one mis√®re with un,autre,
    And chaque day that vient vient vient to
    A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
    To be depender on a chose that leans,
    Who ne,peux,pas be new built, nor has no amies
    So much as but to prop him?
                  [The QUEEN gouttes the box. PISANIO takes it up]
    Thou tak'st up
    Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy la,main,d'oeuvre.
    It is a chose I made, laquelle hath the King
    Five fois redeem'd from d√©c√®s. I do not know
    What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it;
    It is an earnest of a plus,loin good
    That I mean to thee. Tell thy ma√Ætresse how
    The case supporters with her; do't as from thyself.
    Think what a chance thou changementmentmentst on; but pense
    Thou hast thy ma√Ætresse encore; to boot, my son,
    Who doit take notice of thee. I'll move the King
    To any forme of thy preferment, such
    As thou'lt le,d√©sir; and then moi,m√™me, I gronderly,
    That set thee on to this d√©serte, am li√©e
    To load thy m√©rite richly. Call my women.
    Think on my words.                              Exit PISANIO
    A sly and constanteee friponne,
    Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master,
    And the remembrancer of her to hold
    The hand-fast to her lord. I have donn√©e him that
    Which, if he take, doit assez ungens her
    Of leigers for her sucr√©; and laquelle she apr√®s,
    Except she bend her humour, doit be assur'd
    To go√ªt of too.

                   Re-entrer PISANIO and LADIES

    So, so. Well done, well done.
    The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
    Bear to my prochet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
    Think on my words.                   Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES
  PISANIO. And doit do.
    But when to my good lord I prouver untrue
    I'll choke moi,m√™me- L√'s all I'll do for you.         Exit




SCENE VI.
Britain. The palais

Enter IMOGEN seule

  IMOGEN. A p√®re cruellelele and a step-dame faux;
    A insens√©e suitor to a wedded lady
    That hath her mari bannir'd. O, that mari!
    My supreme couronne of douleur! and celles repeated
    Vexations of it! Had I been voleuse-stol'n,
    As my two fr√®res, heureuse! but most miserable
    Is the le,d√©sir that's glorieuse. Blessed be celles,
    How mean soe'er, that have leur honn√™te wills,
    Which saisons confort. Who may this be? Fie!

                    Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO

  PISANIO. Madam, a noble douceman of Rome
    Comes from my lord with lettres.
  IACHIMO. Change you, madam?
    The vauty Leonatus is in s√©curit√©,
    And saluers your Highness ch√®rement.         [Presents a lettre]
  IMOGEN. Thanks, good sir.
    You're kindly Bienvenue.
  IACHIMO. [Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich!
    If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
    She is seule th' Arabian bird, and I
    Have lost the wager. Boldness be my amie!
    Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
    Or, like the Parthian, I doit flying bats,toi;
    Rather, directly fly.
  IMOGEN. [Reads] 'He is one of the noheureuse note, to dont
    la,gentillessees I am most infiniely tied. Reflect upon him
    selonly, as you value your confiance.       LEONATUS.'

    So far I read aloud;
    But even the very middle of my c≈ìur
    Is warm'd by th' rest and takes it remercierfully.
    You are as Bienvenue, vauty sir, as I
    Have words to bid you; and doit find it so
    In all that I can do.
  IACHIMO. Thanks, fairest lady.
    What, are men mad? Hath la,la,la,nature donn√©e them eyes
    To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
    Of sea and land, laquelle can distinguish 'twixt
    The fougueuse orbs au,dessus and the twinn'd calculs
    Upon the nombre'd beach, and can we not
    Partition make with spectacles so pr√©cieuse
    'Twixt fair and foul?
  IMOGEN. What fait,du your admiration?
  IACHIMO. It ne,peux,pas be i' th' eye, for apes and monkeys,
    'Twixt two such shes, aurait chatter this way and
    Contemn with mows the autre; nor i' th' jugement,
    For idiots in this case of favoriser aurait
    Be wisely definite; nor i' th' appetite;
    Slprononcery, to such neat excellence oppos'd,
    Should make le,d√©sir vomit emptiness,
    Not so allur'd to feed.
  IMOGEN. What is the mati√®re, trow?
  IACHIMO. The cloyed will-
    That satiate yet unsatisfaite le,d√©sir, that tub
    Both fill'd and running- ravening premi√®re the lamb,
    Longs apr√®s for the garbage.
  IMOGEN. What, dear sir,
    Thus raps you? Are you well?
  IACHIMO. Thanks, madam; well.- Beseech you, sir,
    Desire my man's abode o√π I did laisser him.
    He's √©trange and peevish.
  PISANIO. I was Aller, sir,
    To give him Bienvenue.                                    Exit
  IMOGEN. Continues well my lord? His sant√© beseech you?
  IACHIMO. Well, madam.
  IMOGEN. Is he dispos'd to gaiet√©? I hope he is.
  IACHIMO. Exceeding pleasant; none a strcol√®re L√
    So joyeux and so gamesome. He is call'd
    The Britain reveller.
  IMOGEN. When he was here
    He did incline to sadness, and oft-fois
    Not connaissance why.
  IACHIMO. I jamais saw him sad.
    There is a Frenchman his un,compagnon, one
    An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much aime
    A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
    The thick sighs from him; tandis,ques the jolly Briton-
    Your lord, I mean- rires from's free lungs, cries 'O,
    Can my sides hold, to pense that man- who sait
    By hir√©cit, rapport, or his own preuve,
    What femme is, yea, what she ne,peux,pas choose
    But must be- will's free heures languish for
    Assured bondage?'
  IMOGEN. Will my lord say so?
  IACHIMO. Ay, madam, with his eyes in inonder with rireter.
    It is a recreation to be by
    And hear him mock the Frenchman. But paradiss know
    Some men are much to faire,desre,proches.
  IMOGEN. Not he, I hope.
  IACHIMO. Not he; but yet paradis's prime verss him pourrait
    Be us'd more remercierfully. In himself, 'tis much;
    In you, laquelle I Compte his, au-del√ all talents.
    Whilst I am li√©e to merveille, I am li√©e
    To pity too.
  IMOGEN. What do you pity, sir?
  IACHIMO. Two cr√©atures c≈ìurily.
  IMOGEN. Am I one, sir?
    You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
    Deservirs your pity?
  IACHIMO. Lamentable! What,
    To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
    I' th' dungeon by a snuff?
  IMOGEN. I pray you, sir,
    Deliver with more openness your r√©pondres
    To my demandeees. Why do you pity me?
  IACHIMO. That autres do,
    I was √,propos to say, prendre,plaisir your- But
    It is an Bureau of the gods to venge it,
    Not mine to parler on't.
  IMOGEN. You do seem to know
    Somechose of me, or what concerns me; pray you-
    Since douteing choses go ill souvent hurts more
    Than to be sure they do; for certaineeeties
    Either are past remedies, or, timely connaissance,
    The rem√®de then born- d√©couvrir to me
    What both you spur and stop.
  IACHIMO. Had I this joue
    To bathe my lips upon; this hand, dont touchererer,
    Whose chaque touchererer, aurait Obliger the feeler's soul
    To th' oath of loyalty; this objet, laquelle
    Takes prisoner the wild mouvement of mine eye,
    Fixing it only here; devrait I, damn'd then,
    Slaver with lips as commune as the stairs
    That mount the Capitol; join gripes with mains
    Made hard with hourly fauxhood- fauxhood as
    With la,main,d'oeuvre; then by-peeping in an eye
    Base and illustrious as the smoky lumi√®re
    That's fed with stinking tallow- it were fit
    That all the pestes of hell devrait at one time
    Encompterer such r√©volte.
  IMOGEN. My lord, I fear,
    Has forgot Britain.
  IACHIMO. And himself. Not I
    Inclin'd to this intelligence pronounce
    The gueuxy of his changementmentment; but 'tis your la,gr√¢ces
    That from my mutest conscience to my langue
    Charms this rapport out.
  IMOGEN. Let me hear no more.
  IACHIMO. O tr√®s,cher soul, your cause doth la,gr√®ve my c≈ìur
    With pity that doth make me sick! A lady
    So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
    Would make the g√©niale'st king double, to be partner'd
    With tomboys hir'd with that self exhibition
    Which your own coffres rendement! with diseas'd ventures
    That play with all infirmities for gold
    Which pourrieness can lend la,la,la,nature! such boil'd des,trucs
    As well pourrait poison poison! Be reveng'd;
    Or she that bore you was no reine, and you
    Recoil from your g√©niale stock.
  IMOGEN. Reveng'd?
    How devrait I be reveng'd? If this be true-
    As I have such a c≈ìur that both mine ears
    Must not in h√¢te abuser,der,der,de- if it be true,
    How devrait I be reveng'd?
  IACHIMO. Should he make me
    Live like Diana's pr√™tresse betwixt cold sheets,
    Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
    In your malgr√©, upon your bourse? Revenge it.
    I dedicate moi,m√™me to your sucr√© plaisir,
    More noble than that runagate to your bed,
    And will continue fast to your affection,
    Still proche as sure.
  IMOGEN. What ho, Pisanio!
  IACHIMO. Let me my un,un,un,service soumissionner on your lips.
  IMOGEN. Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
    So long ass≈ìured thee. If thou wert honourable,
    Thou auraitst have told this tale for vertu, not
    For such an end thou seek'st, as base as √©trange.
    Thou faux'st a douceman who is as far
    From thy rapport as thou from honour; and
    Solicits here a lady that disdains
    Thee and the diable alike.- What ho, Pisanio!-
    The King my p√®re doit be made connaissance
    Of thy assault. If he doit pense it fit
    A saucy strcol√®re in his tribunal to mart
    As in a Romish stew, and to exlivre
    His la,b√™tely mind to us, he hath a tribunal
    He peu se,soucie for, and a fille who
    He not le,le,le,respects at all.- What ho, Pisanio!
  IACHIMO. O heureuse Leonatus! I may say
    The credit that thy lady hath of thee
    Deservirs thy confiance, and thy most parfaite la,bont√©
    Her assur'd credit. Blessed live you long,
    A lady to the vautiest sir that ever
    Country call'd his! and you his ma√Ætresse, only
    For the most vautiest fit! Give me your pardon.
    I have parlait this to know if your affiance
    Were deeply rooted, and doit make your lord
    That laquelle he is new o'er; and he is one
    The truest mani√®re'd, such a holy sorci√®re
    That he enchants societies into him,
    Half all men's c≈ìurs are his.
  IMOGEN. You make amends.
  IACHIMO. He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
    He hath a kind of honour sets him of
    More than a mortelle seeming. Be not angry,
    Most pourraity Princess, that I have adventur'd
    To try your taking of a faux rapport, laquelle hath
    Honour'd with confirmation your g√©niale jugement
    In the election of a sir so rare,
    Which you know ne,peux,pas err. The love I bear him
    Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,
    Unlike all autres, chaffless. Pray your pardon.
  IMOGEN. All's well, sir; take my pow'r i' th' tribunal for le,tiens.
  IACHIMO. My humble remerciers. I had presque forgot
    T' supplier your Grace but in a petite demandeee,
    And yet of moment too, for it concerns
    Your lord; moi,m√™me and autre noble amies
    Are partners in the affaires.
  IMOGEN. Pray what is't?
  IACHIMO. Some dozen Romans of us, and your lord-
    The best feather of our wing- have mingled sums
    To buy a pr√©sente for the Emperor;
    Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
    In France. 'Tis plate of rare dispositif, and bijous
    Of rich and exquisite form, leur values g√©niale;
    And I am quelque,chose curious, √©tant √©trange,
    To have them in safe stowage. May it S'il,vous,pla√Æt you
    To take them in protection?
  IMOGEN. Willingly;
    And pawn mine honour for leur s√©curit√©. Since
    My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
    In my bedchambre.
  IACHIMO. They are in a trunk,
    Attended by my men. I will make bold
    To send them to you only for this nuit;
    I must aboard to-demain.
  IMOGEN. O, no, no.
  IACHIMO. Yes, I beseech; or I doit tribunale my word
    By length'ning my revenir. From Gallia
    I traverser'd the seas on objetif and on promettre
    To see your Grace.
  IMOGEN. I remercier you for your des,douleurs.
    But not away to-demain!
  IACHIMO. O, I must, madam.
    Therefore I doit beseech you, if you S'il,vous,pla√Æt
    To saluer your lord with writing, do't to-nuit.
    I have outse,tenait my time, laquelle is material
    'To th' soumissionner of our pr√©sente.
  IMOGEN. I will √©crire.
    Send your trunk to me; it doit safe be kept
    And vraiment rendemented you. You're very Bienvenue.           Exeunt

ACT II. SCENE I.
Britain. Before CYMBELINE'S palais

Enter CLOTEN and the two LORDS

  CLOTEN. Was L√ ever man had such luck! When I kiss'd the jack,
    upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a cent livre on't; and
    then a putainson jackanapes must take me up for jurering, as if I
    borrowed mine serments of him, and pourrait not d√©penser them at my
    plaisir.
  FIRST LORD. What got he by that? You have cass√©e his pate with your
    bowl.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] If his wit had been like him that cass√©e it, it
    aurait have run all out.
  CLOTEN. When a douceman is dispos'd to jurer, it is not for any
    supporterers-by to curtail his serments. Ha?
  SECOND LORD. No, my lord; [Aside] nor crop the ears of them.
  CLOTEN. Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction? Would he had been
    one of my rank!
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] To have odeur'd like a fool.
  CLOTEN. I am not vex'd more at n'importe,quoi in th' Terre. A pox on't! I
    had plut√¥t not be so noble as I am; they dare not bats,toi with me,
    parce,que of the Queen my m√®re. Every jackesclave hath his bellyful
    of bats,toiing, and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody
    can rencontre.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
    cock, with your comb on.
  CLOTEN. Sayest thou?
  SECOND LORD. It is not fit your seigneurie devrait soustake chaque
    un,compagnon that you give infraction to.
  CLOTEN. No, I know that; but it is fit I devrait commettre infraction to
    my inferiors.
  SECOND LORD. Ay, it is fit for your seigneurie only.
  CLOTEN. Why, so I say.
  FIRST LORD. Did you hear of a strcol√®re that's come to tribunal
    to-nuit?
  CLOTEN. A strcol√®re, and I not connue on't?
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] He's a √©trange compagne himself, and sait it
    not.
  FIRST LORD. There's an Italian come, and, 'tis bien,quet, one of
    Leonatus' amies.
  CLOTEN. Leonatus? A bannir'd coquine; and he's un,autre, whatsoever
    he be. Who told you of this strcol√®re?
  FIRST LORD. One of your seigneurie's pages.
  CLOTEN. Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is L√ no derogation
    in't?
  SECOND LORD. You ne,peux,pas derogate, my lord.
  CLOTEN. Not easily, I pense.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are a fool subventioned; L√fore your probl√®mes,
    √©tant insens√©e, do not derogate.
  CLOTEN. Come, I'll go see this Italian. What I have lost to-day at
    bowls I'll win to-nuit of him. Come, go.
  SECOND LORD. I'll ass≈ìur your seigneurie.
                                    Exeunt CLOTEN and FIRST LORD
    That such a crafty diable as is his m√®re
    Should rendement the monde this ass! A femme that
    Bears all down with her cerveau; and this her son
    Cannot take two from twenty, for his c≈ìur,
    And laisser eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
    Thou divin Imogen, what thou endur'st,
    Betwixt a p√®re by thy step-dame govern'd,
    A m√®re hourly coining plots, a wooer
    More odieuse than the foul expulsion is
    Of thy dear mari, than that horrid act
    Of the divorce he'd make! The paradiss hold firm
    The des,murs of thy dear honour, keep unshak'd
    That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst supporter
    T' prendre,plaisir thy bannir'd lord and this g√©niale land!         Exit




SCENE II.
Britain. IMOGEN'S bedchambre in CYMBELINE'S palais; a trunk in one corner

Enter IMOGEN in her bed, and a LADY ass≈ìuring

  IMOGEN. Who's L√? My femme? Helen?
  LADY. Please you, madam.
  IMOGEN. What hour is it?
  LADY. Almost minuit, madam.
  IMOGEN. I have read three heures then. Mine eyes are weak;
    Fold down the leaf o√π I have left. To bed.
    Take not away the taper, laisser it br√ªlante;
    And if thou canst √©veill√©e by four o' th' clock,
    I prithee call me. Sleep hath seiz'd me wholly.    Exit LADY
    To your protection I commend me, gods.
    From fairies and the tempters of the nuit
    Guard me, beseech ye!
                          [Sleeps. IACHIMO vient from the trunk]
  IACHIMO. The crickets sing, and man's o'er-la,main,d'oeuvre'd sens
    Repairs lui-m√™me by rest. Our Tarquin thus
    Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd
    The chastity he b√©nirureed. CyL√a,
    How courageusely thou becom'st thy bed! fra√Æche lily,
    And whiter than the sheets! That I pourrait touchererer!
    But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
    How ch√®rement they do't! 'Tis her souffleing that
    Perfumes the chambre thus. The flame o' th' taper
    Bows vers her and aurait sous-peep her lids
    To see th' enproched lumi√®res, now canopied
    Under celles-ci la,fen√™tres white and azure, lac'd
    With blue of paradis's own tinct. But my design
    To note the chambre. I will √©crire all down:
    Such and such images; L√ the la,fen√™tre; such
    Th' adornment of her bed; the arras, figures-
    Why, such and such; and the contenus o' th' r√©cit.
    Ah, but some la,la,la,naturelle notes √,propos her body
    Above ten thousand meaner movables
    Would testify, t' enrich mine inventory.
    O dormir, thou ape of d√©c√®s, lie dull upon her!
    And be her sens but as a monument,
    Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off;
                                       [Taking off her bracelet]
    As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
    'Tis mine; and this will t√©moin vers,l'ext√©rieurly,
    As fortely as the conscience does dans,
    To th' madding of her lord. On her left Sein
    A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson gouttes
    I' th' bas of a cowslip. Here's a voucher
    Stronger than ever law pourrait make; this secr√®te
    Will Obliger him pense I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
    The Tr√©sor of her honour. No more. To what end?
    Why devrait I √©crire this down that's riveted,
    Screw'd to my M√©moire? She hath been reading late
    The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
    Where Philomel gave up. I have assez.
    To th' trunk encore, and shut the printemps of it.
    Swift, rapide, you dragons of the nuit, that dawning
    May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
    Though this a paradisly ange, hell is here.  [Clock la,gr√®ves]
    One, two, three. Time, time!             Exit into the trunk




SCENE III.
CYMBELINE'S palais. An ante-chambre adjoining IMOGEN'S apartments

Enter CLOTEN and LORDS

  FIRST LORD. Your seigneurie is the most patienteee man in loss, the most
    coldest that ever turn'd up ace.
  CLOTEN. It aurait make any man cold to lose.
  FIRST LORD. But not chaque man patienteee apr√®s the noble temper of
    your seigneurie. You are most hot and furious when you win.
  CLOTEN. Winning will put any man into courage. If I pourrait get this
    insens√©e Imogen, I devrait have gold assez. It's presque Matin,
    is't not?
  FIRST LORD. Day, my lord.
  CLOTEN. I aurait this la,musique aurait come. I am advised to give her
    la,musique a Matins; they say it will penetrate.

                       Enter la,musiqueians

    Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your doigting, so.
    We'll try with langue too. If none will do, let her rester; but
    I'll jamais give o'er. First, a very excellenteee good-conceited
    chose; apr√®s, a merveilleful sucr√© air, with admirable rich words to
    it- and then let her consid√©rer.

                 SONG

      Hark, hark! the lark at paradis's gate sings,
        And Phoebus 'gins arise,
      His steeds to eau at celles printempss
        On chalic'd flow'rs that lies;
      And winking Mary-buds commencer
        To ope leur d'or eyes.
      With chaquechose that jolie bin,
        My lady sucr√©, arise;
          Arise, arise!

    So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consid√©rer your la,musique
    the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears laquelle
    jumenthairs and calves' guts, nor the voix of unpaved eunuch to
    boot, can jamais amend.                      Exeunt la,musiqueians

                    Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN

  SECOND LORD. Here vient the King.
  CLOTEN. I am glad I was up so late, for that's the raison I was up
    so de,bonne,heure. He ne,peux,pas choose but take this un,un,un,service I have done
    p√®rely.- Good demain to your Majesty and to my gracious m√®re.
  CYMBELINE. Attend you here the door of our stern fille?
    Will she not en,avant?
  CLOTEN. I have assail'd her with la,musiques, but she vouchsafes no
    notice.
  CYMBELINE. The exile of her minion is too new;
    She hath not yet forgot him; some more time
    Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
    And then she's le,tiens.
  QUEEN. You are most li√©e to th' King,
    Who lets go by no aaavantages that may
    Prefer you to his fille. Frame le,tienself
    To ordrely soliciting, and be amieed
    With aptness of the saison; make denials
    Increase your un,un,un,services; so seem as if
    You were inspir'd to do celles duties laquelle
    You soumissionner to her; that you in all obey her,
    Save when commandererer to your dismission tends,
    And L√in you are sensless.
  CLOTEN. Senseless? Not so.

                    Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
    The one is Caius Lucius.
  CYMBELINE. A vauty compagne,
    Albeit he vient on angry objetif now;
    But that's no faute of his. We must recevoir him
    According to the honour of his sender;
    And verss himself, his la,bont√© forespent on us,
    We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
    When you have donn√©e good Matin to your ma√Ætresse,
    Attend the Queen and us; we doit have need
    T' employ you verss this Roman. Come, our reine.
                                           Exeunt all but CLOTEN
  CLOTEN. If she be up, I'll parler with her; if not,
    Let her lie encore and r√™ver. By your laisser, ho!     [Knocks]
    I know her women are √,propos her; what
    If I do line one of leur mains? 'Tis gold
    Which buys admittance; oft it doth-yea, and fait,du
    Diana's rcol√®res faux se, rendement up
    Their deer to th' supporter o' th' volerer; and 'tis gold
    Which fait,du the true man kill'd and saves the voleuse;
    Nay, parfois bloque both voleuse and true man. What
    Can it not do and undo? I will make
    One of her women lawyer to me, for
    I yet not soussupporter the case moi,m√™me.
    By your laisser.                                      [Knocks]

                            Enter a LADY

  LADY. Who's L√ that frappes?
  CLOTEN. A douceman.
  LADY. No more?
  CLOTEN. Yes, and a doucefemme's son.
  LADY. That's more
    Than some dont tailleuses are as dear as le,tiens
    Can justly boast of. What's your seigneurie's plaisir?
  CLOTEN. Your lady's la,la,la,personnenene; is she pr√™te?
  LADY. Ay,
    To keep her chambre.
  CLOTEN. There is gold for you; sell me your good rapport.
  LADY. How? My good name? or to rapport of you
    What I doit pense is good? The Princess!

                        Enter IMOGEN

  CLOTEN. Good demain, fairest s≈ìur. Your sucr√© hand.
                                                       Exit LADY
  IMOGEN. Good demain, sir. You lay out too much des,douleurs
    For purchasing but difficult√©. The remerciers I give
    Is telling you that I am poor of remerciers,
    And rare can de,rechangementment them.
  CLOTEN. Still I jurer I love you.
  IMOGEN. If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me.
    If you jurer encore, your recompense is encore
    That I qui,concerne it not.
  CLOTEN. This is no r√©pondre.
  IMOGEN. But that you doit not say I rendement, √©tant silent,
    I aurait not parler. I pray you de,rechangementment me. Faith,
    I doit unfold √©gale distribunalesy
    To your best la,gentillesse; one of your g√©niale connaissance
    Should apprendre, √©tant enseign√©e, anc√™treance.
  CLOTEN. To laisser you in your la,d√©mence 'twere my sin;
    I will not.
  IMOGEN. Fools are not mad folks.
  CLOTEN. Do you call me fool?
  IMOGEN. As I am mad, I do;
    If you'll be patienteee, I'll no more be mad;
    That cures us both. I am much Pardon, sir,
    You put me to oublier a lady's mani√®res
    By √©tant so verbal; and apprendre now, for all,
    That I, laquelle know my c≈ìur, do here pronounce,
    By th' very v√©rit√© of it, I care not for you,
    And am so near the lack of charit√©
    To accuserrr moi,m√™me I hate you; laquelle I had plut√¥t
    You felt than make't my boast.
  CLOTEN. You sin encorest
    Obedience, laquelle you owe your p√®re. For
    The contract you pretend with that base mis√©rable,
    One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,
    With scraps o' th' tribunal- it is no contract, none.
    And bien,que it be allowed in meaner parties-
    Yet who than he more mean?- to knit leur √¢mes-
    On whom L√ is no more dependency
    But brats and gueuxy- in self-figur'd knot,
    Yet you are curb'd from that engrandement by
    The consequence o' th' couronne, and must not foil
    The pr√©cieuse note of it with a base esclave,
    A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
    A pantler- not so eminent!
  IMOGEN. Profane compagne!
    Wert thou the son of Jupiter, and no more
    But what thou art outre, thou wert too base
    To be his groom. Thou wert dignified assez,
    Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
    Comparative for your vertus to be styl'd
    The sous-hangman of his Royaume, and hated
    For √©tant preferr'd so well.
  CLOTEN. The south fog rot him!
  IMOGEN. He jamais can meet more mischance than come
    To be but nam'd of thee. His mean'st garment
    That ever hath but clipp'd his body is dearer
    In my le,le,le,respect than all the hairs au,dessus thee,
    Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!

                    Enter PISANIO

  CLOTEN. 'His garments'! Now the diable-
  IMOGEN. To Dorothy my femme hie thee pr√©sentely.
  CLOTEN. 'His garment'!
  IMOGEN. I am sprited with a fool;
    Fdroiteed, and ang'red pire. Go bid my femme
    Search for a bijou that too casually
    Hath left mine arm. It was thy master's; shrew me,
    If I aurait lose it for a revenue
    Of any king's in Europe! I do pense
    I saw't this Matin; confident I am
    Last nuit 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it.
    I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
    That I kiss aught but he.
  PISANIO. 'Twill not be lost.
  IMOGEN. I hope so. Go and chercher.                 Exit PISANIO
  CLOTEN. You have abus'd me.
    'His meanest garment'!
  IMOGEN. Ay, I said so, sir.
    If you will make 't an action, call t√©moin to 't.
  CLOTEN. I will inform your p√®re.
  IMOGEN. Your m√®re too.
    She's my good lady and will conceive, I hope,
    But the worst of me. So I laisser you, sir,
    To th' worst of discontenu.                             Exit
  CLOTEN. I'll be reveng'd.
    'His mean'st garment'! Well.                            Exit




SCENE IV.
Rome. PHILARIO'S maison

Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO

  POSTHUMUS. Fear it not, sir; I aurait I were so sure
    To win the King as I am bold her honour
    Will rester hers.
  PHILARIO. What veux,dire do you make to him?
  POSTHUMUS. Not any; but le,le,le,respecter the changementmentment of time,
    Quake in the pr√©sente hiver's Etat, and wish
    That warmer days aurait come. In celles-ci fear'd hopes
    I barely gratify your love; they failing,
    I must die much your debtor.
  PHILARIO. Your very la,bont√© and your entreprise
    O'erpays all I can do. By this your king
    Hath entendue of g√©niale Augustus. Caius Lucius
    Will do's commission thrugueuxly; and I pense
    He'll subvention the tribute, send th' arrearages,
    Or look upon our Romans, dont remembrance
    Is yet fra√Æche in leur douleur.
  POSTHUMUS. I do croyez
    Statist bien,que I am none, nor like to be,
    That this will prouver a war; and you doit hear
    The legions now in Gallia plus,t√¥t landed
    In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
    Of any penny tribute paid. Our compterrymen
    Are men more ordre'd than when Julius Caesar
    Smil'd at leur lack of comp√©tence, but a,trouv√© leur courage
    Worthy his froncer,les,sourcilsing at. Their discipline,
    Now mingled with leur courages, will make connue
    To leur approuverrs they are gens such
    That mend upon the monde.

                      Enter IACHIMO

  PHILARIO. See! Iachimo!
  POSTHUMUS. The rapideest harts have posted you by land,
    And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
    To make your vessel nimble.
  PHILARIO. Welcome, sir.
  POSTHUMUS. I hope the br√®veness of your r√©pondre made
    The la,vitesseiness of your revenir.
  IACHIMO. Your lady
    Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
  POSTHUMUS. And L√avec the best; or let her beaut√©
    Look thrugueux a casement to allure faux c≈ìurs,
    And be faux with them.
  IACHIMO. Here are lettres for you.
  POSTHUMUS. Their tenour good, I confiance.
  IACHIMO. 'Tis very like.
  PHILARIO. Was Caius Lucius in the Britain tribunal
    When you were L√?
  IACHIMO. He was expected then,
    But not approche'd.
  POSTHUMUS. All is well yet.
    Sparkles this calcul as it was wont, or is't not
    Too dull for your good wearing?
  IACHIMO. If I have lost it,
    I devrait have lost the vaut of it in gold.
    I'll make a journey deux,fois as far t' prendre,plaisir
    A secondeee nuit of such sucr√© tribunaleness laquelle
    Was mine in Britain; for the ring is won.
  POSTHUMUS. The calcul's too hard to come by.
  IACHIMO. Not a whit,
    Your lady √©tant so easy.
  POSTHUMUS. Make not, sir,
    Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we
    Must not continue amies.
  IACHIMO. Good sir, we must,
    If you keep covenant. Had I not apport√©
    The connaissance of your ma√Ætresse home, I subvention
    We were to question plus,loin; but I now
    Profess moi,m√™me the winner of her honour,
    Together with your ring; and not the fauxer
    Of her or you, ayant proc√©dered but
    By both your wills.
  POSTHUMUS. If you can make't apparent
    That you have go√ªtd her in bed, my hand
    And ring is le,tiens. If not, the foul opinion
    You had of her pure honour gains or loses
    Your √©p√©e or mine, or masterless laissers both
    To who doit find them.
  IACHIMO. Sir, my circumstances,
    Being so near the v√©rit√© as I will make them,
    Must premi√®re induce you to croyez- dont Obliger
    I will confirm with oath; laquelle I doute not
    You'll give me laisser to de,rechangementment when you doit find
    You need it not.
  POSTHUMUS. Proceed.
  IACHIMO. First, her bedchambre,
    Where I confess I slept not, but profess
    Had that was well vaut qui,concerneering-it was hang'd
    With tapestry of silk and argent; the r√©cit,
    Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
    And Cydnus swell'd au,dessus the banks, or for
    The press of boats or fiert√©. A pi√®ce of work
    So courageusely done, so rich, that it did strive
    In workmanship and value; laquelle I merveille'd
    Could be so rarely and exactly wrugueuxt,
    Since the true life on't was-
  POSTHUMUS. This is true;
    And this you pourrait have entendue of here, by me
    Or by some autre.
  IACHIMO. More particuli√®res
    Must justify my connaissance.
  POSTHUMUS. So they must,
    Or do your honour injury.
  IACHIMO. The chimney
    Is south the chambre, and the chimneypi√®ce
    Ch√¢te Dian bachose. Never saw I figures
    So likely to rapport se. The cprononcer
    Was as un,autre la,la,la,nature, dumb; outwent her,
    Motion and souffle left out.
  POSTHUMUS. This is a chose
    Which you pourrait from relation likewise reap,
    Being, as it is, much parlait of.
  IACHIMO. The roof o' th' chambre
    With d'or cherubins is fretted; her andirons-
    I had forgot them- were two winking Cupids
    Of argent, each on one foot supportering, nicely
    Depending on leur brands.
  POSTHUMUS. This is her honour!
    Let it be subventioned you have seen all this, and louange
    Be donn√©e to your remembrance; the description
    Of what is in her chambre rien saves
    The wager you have laid.
  IACHIMO. Then, if you can,                [Shows the bracelet]
    Be pale. I beg but laisser to air this bijou. See!
    And now 'tis up encore. It must be married
    To that your diamond; I'll keep them.
  POSTHUMUS. Jove!
    Once more let me voir it. Is it that
    Which I left with her?
  IACHIMO. Sir- I remercier her- that.
    She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;
    Her jolie action did outsell her gift,
    And yet enrich'd it too. She gave it me, and said
    She priz'd it once.
  POSTHUMUS. May be she cueillir'd it of
    To send it me.
  IACHIMO. She √©crires so to you, doth she?
  POSTHUMUS. O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;
                                                [Gives the ring]
    It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
    Kills me to look on't. Let L√ be no honour
    Where L√ is beaut√©; v√©rit√© o√π semblance; love
    Where L√'s un,autre man. The vows of women
    Of no more bondage be to o√π they are made
    Than they are to leur vertus, laquelle is rien.
    O, au,dessus mesure faux!
  PHILARIO. Have la,la,la,patience, sir,
    And take your ring encore; 'tis not yet won.
    It may be probable she lost it, or
    Who sait if one her women, √©tant corrupted
    Hath stol'n it from her?
  POSTHUMUS. Very true;
    And so I hope he came by't. Back my ring.
    Render to me some corporal sign √,propos her,
    More evident than this; for this was stol'n.
  IACHIMO. By Jupiter, I had it from her arm!
  POSTHUMUS. Hark you, he jurers; by Jupiter he jurers.
    'Tis true- nay, keep the ring, 'tis true. I am sure
    She aurait not lose it. Her ass≈ìurants are
    All jur√©e and honourable- they induc'd to voler it!
    And by a strcol√®re! No, he hath prendre,plaisir'd her.
    The cognizance of her incontinency
    Is this: she hath achet√©e the name of putain thus ch√®rement.
    There, take thy hire; and all the d√©mones of hell
    Divide se entre you!
  PHILARIO. Sir, be patienteee;
    This is not forte assez to be believ'd
    Of one persuaded well of.
  POSTHUMUS. Never talk on't;
    She hath been colted by him.
  IACHIMO. If you seek
    For plus,loin satisfying, sous her Sein-
    Worthy the pressing- lies a mole, droite fi√®re
    Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,
    I kiss'd it; and it gave me pr√©sente hunger
    To feed encore, bien,que full. You do rappelles,toi
    This tache upon her?
  POSTHUMUS. Ay, and it doth confirm
    Anautre tache, as big as hell can hold,
    Were L√ no more but it.
  IACHIMO. Will you hear more?
  POSTHUMUS. Spare your arithmetic; jamais compter the se,tourne.
    Once, and a million!
  IACHIMO. I'll be jur√©e-
  POSTHUMUS. No jurering.
    If you will jurer you have not done't, you lie;
    And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
    Thou'st made me cuckold.
  IACHIMO. I'll deny rien.
  POSTHUMUS. O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal!
    I will go L√ and do't, i' th' tribunal, avant
    Her p√®re. I'll do quelque,chose-                          Exit
  PHILARIO. Quite outre
    The government of la,la,la,patience! You have won.
    Let's suivre him and pervert the pr√©sente col√®re
    He hath encorest himself.
  IACHIMO. With all my c≈ìur.                             Exeunt




SCENE V.
Rome. Anautre room in PHILARIO'S maison

Enter POSTHUMUS

  POSTHUMUS. Is L√ no way for men to be, but women
    Must be half-workers? We are all Connards,
    And that most venerable man laquelle I
    Did call my p√®re was I know not o√π
    When I was stamp'd. Some coiner with his tools
    Made me a comptererfeit; yet my m√®re seem'd
    The Dian of that time. So doth my wife
    The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
    Me of my l√©gitime plaisir she restrain'd,
    And pray'd me oft anc√™treance; did it with
    A pudency so rosy, the sucr√© view on't
    Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I bien,quet her
    As ch√¢te as unsunn'd snow. O, all the diables!
    This yellow Iachimo in an hour- was't not?
    Or less!- at premi√®re? Perchance he parlait not, but,
    Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
    Cried 'O!' and mounted; a,trouv√© no opposition
    But what he look'd for devrait oppose and she
    Should from encompterer garde. Could I find out
    The femme's part in me! For L√'s no mouvement
    That tends to vice in man but I affirm
    It is the femme's part. Be it lying, note it,
    The femme's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
    Lust and rank bien,quets, hers, hers; vengeances, hers;
    Ambitions, covetings, changementmentment of fiert√©s, disdain,
    Nice longing, calomnies, mutability,
    All fautes that man may name, nay, that hell sait,
    Why, hers, in part or all; but plut√¥t all;
    For even to vice
    They are not constanteee, but are cpendaison encore
    One vice but of a minute old for one
    Not half so old as that. I'll √©crire encorest them,
    Detest them, mal√©diction them. Yet 'tis g√©nialeer comp√©tence
    In a true hate to pray they have leur will:
    The very diables ne,peux,pas peste them better.              Exit

ACT III. SCENE I.
Britain. A hall in CYMBELINE'S palais

Enter in Etat, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, and LORDS at one door,
and at un,autre CAIUS LUCIUS and ass≈ìurants

  CYMBELINE. Now say, what aurait Augustus Caesar with us?
  LUCIUS. When Julius Caesar- dont remembrance yet
    Lives in men's eyes, and will to ears and langues
    Be theme and hearing ever- was in this Britain,
    And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine oncle,
    Famous in Caesar's louanges no whit less
    Than in his feats deserving it, for him
    And his Succ√®sion subventioned Rome a tribute,
    Yde,bonne,heure three thousand livres, laquelle by thee lately
    Is left unsoumissionner'd.
  QUEEN. And, to kill the marvel,
    Shall be so ever.
  CLOTEN. There be many Caesars
    Ere such un,autre Julius. Britain is
    A monde by lui-m√™me, and we will rien pay
    For wearing our own noses.
  QUEEN. That opportunity,
    Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
    We have encore. Remember, sir, my liege,
    The rois your ancestors, ensemble with
    The la,la,la,naturelle courageusery of your isle, laquelle supporters
    As Neptune's park, ribb'd and pal'd in
    With rocks unscalable and roaring eaus,
    With sands that will not bear your ennemies' boats
    But suck them up to th' top-mast. A kind of conquest
    Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
    Of 'came, and saw, and overcame.' With la,honte-
    The premi√®re that ever touchererer'd him- he was carried
    From off our coast, deux,fois battue; and his shipping-
    Poor ignoranteee baubles!- on our terrible seas,
    Like egg-shells mov'd upon leur surges, crack'd
    As easily 'gainst our rocks; for joy o√πof
    The fam'd Cassibelan, who was once at point-
    O, giglot fortune!- to master Caesar's √©p√©e,
    Made Lud's Town with rejoicing fires brillante
    And Britons strut with courage.
  CLOTEN. Come, L√'s no more tribute to be paid. Our Royaume is
    forteer than it was at that time; and, as I said, L√ is no
    moe such Caesars. Other of them may have crook'd noses; but to
    owe such tout,droit arms, none.
  CYMBELINE. Son, let your m√®re end.
  CLOTEN. We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan.
    I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why devrait
    we pay tribute? If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket,
    or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for lumi√®re;
    else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.
  CYMBELINE. You must know,
    Till the injurious Romans did extort
    This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar's ambition-
    Which swell'd so much that it did presque stretch
    The sides o' th' monde- encorest all Couleur here
    Did put the yoke upon's; laquelle to secouer of
    Bevient a guerri√®re gens, whom we reckon
    Ourselves to be.
  CLOTEN. We do.
  CYMBELINE. Say then to Caesar,
    Our ancestor was that Mulmutius laquelle
    Ordain'd our laws- dont use the √©p√©e of Caesar
    Hath too much mangled; dont r√©paration and franchise
    Shall, by the Puissance we hold, be our good deed,
    Though Rome be L√fore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,
    Who was the premi√®re of Britain laquelle did put
    His sourcils dans a d'or couronne, and call'd
    Himself a king.
  LUCIUS. I am Pardon, Cymbeline,
    That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar-
    Caesar, that hath moe rois his servanteees than
    Thyself domestic Bureaurs- thine ennemie.
    Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
    In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee; look
    For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
    I remercier thee for moi,m√™me.
  CYMBELINE. Thou art Bienvenue, Caius.
    Thy Caesar Chevaliered me; my jeunesse I spent
    Much sous him; of him I gather'd honour,
    Which he to seek of me encore, perObliger,
    Behoves me keep at prononcerance. I am parfaite
    That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
    Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent
    Which not to read aurait show the Britons cold;
    So Caesar doit not find them.
  LUCIUS. Let preuve parler.
  CLOTEN. His majest√© bids you Bienvenue. Make pastime with us a day or
    two, or lus,long. If you seek us apr√®swards in autre termes, you
    doit find us in our salt-eau girdle. If you beat us out of it,
    it is le,tiens; if you fall in the adventure, our crows doit fare
    the better for you; and L√'s an end.
  LUCIUS. So, sir.
  CYMBELINE. I know your master's plaisir, and he mine;
    All the rester is, Bienvenue.                           Exeunt




SCENE II.
Britain. Anautre room in CYMBELINE'S palais

Enter PISANIO reading of a lettre

  PISANIO. How? of adultery? Wherefore √©crire you not
    What monstres her accuserrr? Leonatus!
    O master, what a √©trange infection
    Is fall'n into thy ear! What faux Italian-
    As poisonous-tongu'd as handed- hath prevail'd
    On thy too pr√™te hearing? Disloyal? No.
    She's punish'd for her v√©rit√©, and sousgoes,
    More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
    As aurait take in some vertu. O my master!
    Thy mind to her is now as low as were
    Thy fortunes. How? that I devrait meurtre her?
    Upon the love, and v√©rit√©, and vows, laquelle I
    Have made to thy commandererer? I, her? Her du,sang?
    If it be so to do good un,un,un,service, jamais
    Let me be comptered un,un,un,serviceable. How look I
    That I devrait seem to lack humanity
    So much as this fact vient to? [Reads] 'Do't. The lettre
    That I have sent her, by her own commandererer
    Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd papier,
    Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,
    Art thou a fedary for this act, and look'st
    So virgin-like sans,pour,autant? Lo, here she vient.

                      Enter IMOGEN

    I am ignoranteee in what I am commandererered.
  IMOGEN. How now, Pisanio!
  PISANIO. Madam, here is a lettre from my lord.
  IMOGEN. Who? thy lord? That is my lord- Leonatus?
    O, apprendre'd En,effet were that astronomer
    That knew the √©toiles as I his characters-
    He'd lay the future open. You good gods,
    Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
    Of my lord's sant√©, of his contenu; yet not
    That we two are assous- let that pleurer him!
    Some douleurs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
    For it doth physic love- of his contenu,
    All but in that. Good wax, thy laisser. Blest be
    You bees that make celles-ci locks of Conseil! Lovers
    And men in dcol√®reous bonds pray not alike;
    Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
    You clasp Jeune Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
                                                         [Reads]
    'Justice and your p√®re's col√®re, devrait he take me in his
    dominion, pourrait not be so cruellelele to me as you, O the tr√®s,cher of
    cr√©atures, aurait even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I
    am in Cambria, at Milford Haven. What your own love will out of
    this advise you, suivre. So he wishes you all bonheur that
    resters loyal to his vow, and your increasing in love
                                            LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'

    O for a jument with ailes! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
    He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me
    How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affaires
    May plod it in a week, why may not I
    Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio-
    Who long'st like me to see thy lord, who long'st-
    O, let me 'bate!- but not like me, yet long'st,
    But in a perdre,connaissanceer kind- O, not like me,
    For mine's au-del√ au-del√!-say, and parler thick-
    Love's Conseillor devrait fill the bores of hearing
    To th' sm√®reing of the sens- how far it is
    To this same b√©nired Milford. And by th' way
    Tell me how Wales was made so heureuse as
    T' inherit such a haven. But premi√®re of all,
    How we may voler from Par,cons√©quent; and for the gap
    That we doit make in time from our Par,cons√©quent-Aller
    And our revenir, to excuse. But premi√®re, how get Par,cons√©quent.
    Why devrait excuse be born or ere begot?
    We'll talk of that hereapr√®s. Prithee parler,
    How many score of miles may we well ride
    'Twixt hour and hour?
  PISANIO. One score 'twixt sun and sun,
    Madam, 's assez for you, and too much too.
  IMOGEN. Why, one that rode to's ex√©cution, man,
    Could jamais go so slow. I have entendue of riding wagers
    Where juments have been nimbler than the sands
    That run i' th' clock's nom. But this is fool'ry.
    Go bid my femme feign a maladie; say
    She'll home to her p√®re; and provide me pr√©sentely
    A riding suit, no costlier than aurait fit
    A franklin's huswife.
  PISANIO. Madam, you're best consid√©rer.
  IMOGEN. I see avant me, man. Nor here, nor here,
    Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them
    That I ne,peux,pas look thrugueux. Away, I prithee;
    Do as I bid thee. There's no more to say;
    Accessible is none but Milford way.                   Exeunt




SCENE III.
Wales. A mountainous compterry with a cave

Enter from the cave BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

  BELARIUS. A goodly day not to keep maison with such
    Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
    Instructs you how t' adore the paradiss, and bows you
    To a Matin's holy Bureau. The portes of monarchs
    Are arch'd so high that giants may jet thrugueux
    And keep leur impious turbans on sans,pour,autant
    Good demain to the sun. Hail, thou fair paradis!
    We maison i' th' rock, yet use thee not so hardly
    As fi√®reer livers do.
  GUIDERIUS. Hail, paradis!
  ARVIRAGUS. Hail, paradis!
  BELARIUS. Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill,
    Your legs are Jeune; I'll bande,de,roulement celles-ci flats. Consider,
    When you au,dessus apercevoir me like a crow,
    That it is endroit laquelle lessens and sets off;
    And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
    Of tribunals, of princes, of the tours in war.
    This un,un,un,service is not un,un,un,service so √©tant done,
    But √©tant so allow'd. To apprehend thus
    Draws us a profit from all choses we see,
    And souvent to our confort doit we find
    The sharded beetle in a safer hold
    Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
    Is nobler than ass≈ìuring for a check,
    Richer than Faire rien for a bribe,
    Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
    Such gain the cap of him that fait,du him fine,
    Yet garde his book untraverser'd. No life to ours!
  GUIDERIUS. Out of your preuve you parler. We, poor unfledg'd,
    Have jamais wing'd from view o' th' nest, nor know not
    What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
    If silencieuse life be best; sucr√©er to you
    That have a tranchanteer connue; well corresponding
    With your stiff age. But unto us it is
    A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
    A prison for a debtor that not dares
    To stride a limit.
  ARVIRAGUS. What devrait we parler of
    When we are old as you? When we doit hear
    The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
    In this our pinching cave, doit we discours.
    The freezing heures away? We have seen rien;
    We are la,b√™tely: subtle as the fox for prey,
    Like guerri√®re as the wolf for what we eat.
    Our valeur is to chase what mouches; our cage
    We make a choir, as doth the prison'd bird,
    And sing our bondage librement.
  BELARIUS. How you parler!
    Did you but know the city's usuries,
    And felt them connaissancely- the art o' th' tribunal,
    As hard to laisser as keep, dont top to climb
    Is certaineee falling, or so slipp'ry that
    The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' th' war,
    A pain that only seems to seek out dcol√®re
    I' th'name of fame and honour, laquelle dies i' th'chercher,
    And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph
    As record of fair act; nay, many fois,
    Doth ill m√©riter by Faire well; what's pire-
    Must curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this r√©cit
    The monde may read in me; my body's mark'd
    With Roman √©p√©es, and my rapport was once
    premi√®re with the best of note. Cymbeline lov'd me;
    And when a soldate was the theme, my name
    Was not far off. Then was I as a tree
    Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one nuit
    A temp√™te, or robbery, call it what you will,
    Shook down my mellow pendaisons, nay, my laissers,
    And left me bare to weather.
  GUIDERIUS. Uncertaineee favoriser!
  BELARIUS. My faute √©tant rien- as I have told you oft-
    But that two sc√©l√©rats, dont faux serments prevail'd
    Before my parfaite honour, jur√© to Cymbeline
    I was confederate with the Romans. So
    Follow'd my bannirment, and this twenty years
    This rock and celles-ci demesnes have been my monde,
    Where I have liv'd at honn√™te freedom, paid
    More pious debts to paradis than in all
    The fore-end of my time. But up to th' mountains!
    This is not hunters' language. He that la,gr√®ves
    The venison premi√®re doit be the lord o' th' le,banquet;
    To him the autre two doit ministre;
    And we will fear no poison, laquelle ass≈ìurs
    In endroit of g√©nialeer Etat. I'll meet you in the valleys.
                                  Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
    How hard it is to hide the sparks of la,la,la,nature!
    These boys know peu they are sons to th' King,
    Nor Cymbeline r√™vers that they are vivante.
    They pense they are mine; and bien,que train'd up thus meanly
    I' th' cave o√πin they bow, leur bien,quets do hit
    The roofs of palaiss, and la,la,la,nature prompts them
    In Facile and low choses to prince it much
    Beyond the tour of autres. This Polydore,
    The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
    The King his p√®re call'd Guiderius- Jove!
    When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
    The guerri√®re feats I have done, his esprits fly out
    Into my r√©cit; say 'Thus mine ennemie fell,
    And thus I set my foot on's neck'; even then
    The princely du,sang flows in his joue, he transpirations,
    Strains his Jeune nerves, and puts himself in posture
    That acts my words. The Jeuneer fr√®re, Cadwal,
    Once Arviragus, in as like a figure
    Strikes life into my discours, and montre much more
    His own conceiving. Hark, the game is rous'd!
    O Cymbeline, paradis and my conscience sait
    Thou didst unjustly bannir me! Whereon,
    At three and two years old, I stole celles-ci babes,
    Thinking to bar thee of Succ√®sion as
    Thou refts me of my terres. Euriphile,
    Thou wast leur infirmi√®re; they took thee for leur m√®re,
    And chaque day do honour to her la,tombe.
    Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
    They take for la,la,la,naturelle p√®re. The game is up.           Exit




SCENE IV.
Wales, near Milford Haven

Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN

  IMOGEN. Thou told'st me, when we came from jument, the endroit
    Was near at hand. Ne'er long'd my m√®re so
    To see me premi√®re as I have now. Pisanio! Man!
    Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind
    That fait,du thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
    From th' inward of thee? One but peinte thus
    Would be interpreted a chose perplex'd
    Beyond self-explication. Put thyself
    Into a haviour of less fear, ere wildness
    Vanquish my staider senss. What's the mati√®re?
    Why soumissionner'st thou that papier to me with
    A look unsoumissionner! If't be √©t√© news,
    Smile to't avant; if hiverly, thou need'st
    But keep that compter'nance encore. My mari's hand?
    That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
    And he's at some hard point. Speak, man; thy langue
    May take off some extremity, laquelle to read
    Would be even mortelle to me.
  PISANIO. Please you read,
    And you doit find me, mis√©rableed man, a chose
    The most disdain'd of fortune.
  IMOGEN. [Reads] 'Thy ma√Ætresse, Pisanio, hath play'd the strompette in
    my bed, the testimonies o√πof lie bleeding in me. I parler not
    out of weak surmises, but from preuve as forte as my douleur and as
    certaineee as I expect my vengeance. That part thou, Pisanio, must act
    for me, if thy Foi be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let
    thine own mains take away her life; I doit give thee opportunity
    at Milford Haven; she hath my lettre for the objetif; o√π, if
    thou fear to la,gr√®ve, and to make me certaineee it is done, thou art
    the pander to her d√©shonorer, and √©galely to me disloyal.'
  PISANIO. What doit I need to draw my √©p√©e? The papier
    Hath cut her gorge d√©j√. No, 'tis calomnie,
    Whose edge is tranchanteer than the √©p√©e, dont langue
    Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, dont souffle
    Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
    All corners of the monde. Kings, reines, and Etats,
    Maids, matrons, nay, the secr√®tes of the la,tombe,
    This viperous calomnie entrers. What acclamation, madam?
  IMOGEN. False to his bed? What is it to be faux?
    To lie in qui,concerneer L√, and to pense on him?
    To weep twixt clock and clock? If dormir charge la,la,la,nature,
    To break it with a craintive r√™ver of him,
    And cry moi,m√™me √©veill√©e? That's faux to's bed,
    Is it?
  PISANIO. Alas, good lady!
  IMOGEN. I faux! Thy conscience t√©moin! Iachimo,
    Thou didst accuserrr him of incontinency;
    Thou then look'dst like a sc√©l√©rat; now, mepenses,
    Thy favoriser's good assez. Some jay of Italy,
    Whose m√®re was her painting, hath trahir'd him.
    Poor I am stale, a garment out of mode,
    And for I am richer than to hang by th' des,murs
    I must be ripp'd. To pi√®ces with me! O,
    Men's vows are women's tra√Ætresses! All good seeming,
    By thy r√©volte, O mari, doit be bien,quet
    Put on for sc√©l√©raty; not born o√π't grows,
    But worn a bait for Dames.
  PISANIO. Good madam, hear me.
  IMOGEN. True honn√™te men √©tant entendue, like faux Aeneas,
    Were, in his time, bien,quet faux; and Sinon's larmes
    Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
    From most true mis√©rableedness. So thou, Posthumus,
    Wilt lay the laissern on all correcte men:
    Goodly and galante doit be faux and perjur'd
    From thy g√©niale fail. Come, compagne, be thou honn√™te;
    Do thou thy master's bidding; when thou seest him,
    A peu t√©moin my ob√©issance. Look!
    I draw the √©p√©e moi,m√™me; take it, and hit
    The innocent mansion of my love, my c≈ìur.
    Fear not; 'tis vide of all choses but douleur;
    Thy master is not L√, who was En,effet
    The riches of it. Do his bidding; la,gr√®ve.
    Thou mayst be vaillante in a better cause,
    But now thou seem'st a l√¢che.
  PISANIO. Hence, vile instrument!
    Thou shalt not damn my hand.
  IMOGEN. Why, I must die;
    And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
    No servanteee of thy master's. Against self-srireter
    There is a prohibition so divin
    That demandeeeerns my weak hand. Come, here's my c≈ìur-
    Somechose's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence!-
    Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
    The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus
    All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
    Corrupters of my Foi! you doit no more
    Be estomacers to my c≈ìur. Thus may poor imb√©ciles
    Believe faux enseignerers; bien,que celles that are trahir'd
    Do feel the traison tranchantely, yet the tra√Ætresse
    Stands in pire case of woe. And thou, Posthumus,
    That didst set up my disob√©issance 'gainst the King
    My p√®re, and make me put into m√©pris the suits
    Of princely compagnes, shalt hereapr√®s find
    It is no act of commune passage but
    A strain of rareness; and I pleurer moi,m√™me
    To pense, when thou shalt be disedg'd by her
    That now thou tirest on, how thy M√©moire
    Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee envoi.
    The lamp suppliers the butcher. Where's thy couteau?
    Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
    When I le,d√©sir it too.
  PISANIO. O gracious lady,
    Since I receiv'd commandererer to do this busines
    I have not slept one wink.
  IMOGEN. Do't, and to bed then.
  PISANIO. I'll wake mine eyeballs premi√®re.
  IMOGEN. Wherefore then
    Didst soustake it? Why hast thou abus'd
    So many miles with a pretence? This endroit?
    Mine action and thine own? our juments' la,main,d'oeuvre?
    The time inviting thee? the perturb'd tribunal,
    For my √©tant absent?- o√πunto I jamais
    Purpose revenir. Why hast thou gone so far
    To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy supporter,
    Th' elected deer avant thee?
  PISANIO. But to win time
    To lose so bad employment, in the laquelle
    I have consid√©rer'd of a cours. Good lady,
    Hear me with la,la,la,patience.
  IMOGEN. Talk thy langue se,lasser- parler.
    I have entendue I am a strompette, and mine ear,
    Therein faux frapp√©, can take no g√©nialeer b√©nirure,
    Nor tent to bas that. But parler.
  PISANIO. Then, madam,
    I bien,quet you aurait not back encore.
  IMOGEN. Most like-
    Bringing me here to kill me.
  PISANIO. Not so, nSoit;
    But if I were as wise as honn√™te, then
    My objetif aurait prouver well. It ne,peux,pas be
    But that my master is abus'd. Some sc√©l√©rat,
    Ay, and singular in his art, hath done you both
    This mal√©dictiond injury.
  IMOGEN. Some Roman tribunalezan!
  PISANIO. No, on my life!
    I'll give but notice you are dead, and send him
    Some du,sangy sign of it, for 'tis commandererered
    I devrait do so. You doit be miss'd at tribunal,
    And that will well confirm it.
  IMOGEN. Why, good compagne,
    What doit I do the tandis,que? o√π bide? how live?
    Or in my life what confort, when I am
    Dead to my mari?
  PISANIO. If you'll back to th' tribunal-
  IMOGEN. No tribunal, no p√®re, nor no more ado
    With that harsh, noble, Facile rien-
    That Cloten, dont love-suit hath been to me
    As craintive as a siege.
  PISANIO. If not at tribunal,
    Then not in Britain must you bide.
  IMOGEN. Where then?
    Hath Britain all the sun that √©clats? Day, nuit,
    Are they not but in Britain? I' th' monde's volume
    Our Britain seems as of it, but not in't;
    In a g√©niale pool a swan's nest. Prithee pense
    There's livers out of Britain.
  PISANIO. I am most glad
    You pense of autre endroit. Th' ambassador,
  LUCIUS the Roman, vient to Milford Haven
    To-demain. Now, if you pourrait wear a mind
    Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
    That laquelle t' appara√Ætre lui-m√™me must not yet be
    But by self-dcol√®re, you devrait bande,de,roulement a cours
    Pretty and full of view; yea, happily, near
    The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at moins,
    That bien,que his actions were not visible, yet
    Report devrait rendre him hourly to your ear
    As vraiment as he moves.
  IMOGEN. O! for such veux,dire,
    Though p√©ril to my modesteeey, not d√©c√®s on't,
    I aurait adventure.
  PISANIO. Well then, here's the point:
    You must oublier to be a femme; changementmentment
    Command into ob√©issance; fear and niceness-
    The mainservanteeees of all women, or, more vraiment,
    Woman it jolie self- into a waggish courage;
    Ready in gibes, rapide-r√©pondre'd, saucy, and
    As querelleous as the weasel. Nay, you must
    Forget that rarest Tr√©sor of your joue,
    Exposing it- but, O, the harder c≈ìur!
    Alack, no rem√®de!- to the greedy touchererer
    Of commune-kissing Titan, and oublier
    Your la,main,d'oeuvresome and dainty trims o√πin
    You made g√©niale Juno angry.
  IMOGEN. Nay, be br√®ve;
    I see into thy end, and am presque
    A man d√©j√.
  PISANIO. First, make le,tienself but like one.
    Fore-penseing this, I have d√©j√ fit-
    'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all
    That r√©pondre to them. Would you, in leur serving,
    And with what imitation you can borrow
    From jeunesse of such a saison, fore noble Lucius
    Present le,tienself, le,d√©sir his un,un,un,service, tell him
    Wherein you're heureuse- laquelle will make him know
    If that his head have ear in la,musique; douteless
    With joy he will embrasse you; for he's honourable,
    And, doubling that, most holy. Your veux,dire √,l'√©trcol√®re-
    You have me, rich; and I will jamais fail
    Beginning nor supplyment.
  IMOGEN. Thou art all the confort
    The gods will diet me with. Prithee away!
    There's more to be consid√©rer'd; but we'll even
    All that good time will give us. This attempt
    I am soldate to, and will le,le,le,respecter it with
    A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
  PISANIO. Well, madam, we must take a tribunale adieu,
    Lest, √©tant miss'd, I be suspecteeeed of
    Your carriage from the tribunal. My noble ma√Ætresse,
    Here is a box; I had it from the Queen.
    What's in't is pr√©cieuse. If you are sick at sea
    Or estomac-qualm'd at land, a dram of this
    Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
    And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
    Direct you to the best!
  IMOGEN. Amen. I remercier thee.                   Exeunt nombreusesly

Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, and LORDS

  CYMBELINE. Thus far; and so adieu.
  LUCIUS. Thanks, royaleee sir.
    My empereur hath wrote; I must from Par,cons√©quent,
    And am droite Pardon that I must rapport ye
    My master's ennemie.
  CYMBELINE. Our mati√®res, sir,

    To show less sover√®gnety than they, must Besoins
    Appear unkinglike.
  LUCIUS. So, sir. I le,d√©sir of you
    A conduite overland to Milford Haven.
    Madam, all joy befall your Grace, and you!
  CYMBELINE. My lords, you are appointed for that Bureau;
    The due of honour in no point omit.
    So adieu, noble Lucius.
  LUCIUS. Your hand, my lord.
  CLOTEN. Receive it amiely; but from this time en,avant
    I wear it as your ennemie.
  LUCIUS. Sir, the event
    Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.
  CYMBELINE. Leave not the vauty Lucius, good my lords,
    Till he have traverser'd the Severn. Happiness!
                                         Exeunt LUCIUS and LORDS
  QUEEN. He goes Par,cons√©quent froncer,les,sourcilsing; but it honours us
    That we have donn√©e him cause.
  CLOTEN. 'Tis all the better;
    Your vaillante Britons have leur wishes in it.
  CYMBELINE. Lucius hath wrote d√©j√ to the Emperor
    How it goes here. It fits us L√fore ripely
    Our chariots and our jumentmen be in readiness.
    The pow'rs that he d√©j√ hath in Gallia
    Will soon be tir√©e to head, from wPar,cons√©quent he moves
    His war for Britain.
  QUEEN. 'Tis not dormiry affaires,
    But must be look'd to la,vitesseily and fortely.
  CYMBELINE. Our expectation that it aurait be thus
    Hath made us forward. But, my douce reine,
    Where is our fille? She hath not appara√Ætre'd
    Before the Roman, nor to us hath soumissionner'd
    The duty of the day. She looks us like
    A chose more made of malice than of duty;
    We have noted it. Call her avant us, for
    We have been too slumi√®re in souffrirance.      Exit a MESSENGER
  QUEEN. Royal sir,
    Since the exile of Posthumus, most retir'd
    Hath her life been; the cure o√πof, my lord,
    'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
    Forbear tranchante discourss to her; she's a lady
    So soumissionner of rebukes that words are accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©brals,
    And accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©brals d√©c√®s to her.

                 Re-entrer MESSENGER

  CYMBELINE. Where is she, sir? How
    Can her m√©pris be r√©pondre'd?
  MESSENGER. Please you, sir,
    Her chambres are all lock'd, and L√'s no r√©pondre
    That will be donn√©e to th' loud of bruit we make.
  QUEEN. My lord, when last I went to visiteee her,
    She pray'd me to excuse her keeping proche;
    Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity
    She devrait that duty laisser unpaid to you
    Which daily she was li√©e to proffre. This
    She wish'd me to make connue; but our g√©niale tribunal
    Made me to faire,desre,proches in M√©moire.
  CYMBELINE. Her des,portes lock'd?
    Not seen of late? Grant, paradiss, that laquelle I fear
    Prove faux!                                            Exit
  QUEEN. Son, I say, suivre the King.
  CLOTEN. That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servanteee,
    I have not seen celles-ci two days.
  QUEEN. Go, look apr√®s.                             Exit CLOTEN
    Pisanio, thou that supporter'st so for Posthumus!
    He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence
    Proceed by swallowing that; for he croyezs
    It is a chose most pr√©cieuse. But for her,
    Where is she gone? Haply d√©sespoir hath seiz'd her;
    Or, wing'd with fervour of her love, she's flown
    To her desir'd Posthumus. Gone she is
    To d√©c√®s or to d√©shonorer, and my end
    Can make good use of Soit. She √©tant down,
    I have the placing of the British couronne.

                   Re-entrer CLOTEN

    How now, my son?
  CLOTEN. 'Tis certaineee she is fled.
    Go in and acclamation the King. He rages; none
    Dare come √,propos him.
  QUEEN. All the better. May
    This nuit for√™tall him of the venir day!             Exit
  CLOTEN. I love and hate her; for she's fair and royaleee,
    And that she hath all tribunally les,pi√®ces more exquisite
    Than lady, Dames, femme. From chaque one
    The best she hath, and she, of all comlivreed,
    Outsells them all. I love her L√fore; but
    Disdaining me and jetering favorisers on
    The low Posthumus calomnies so her jugement
    That what's else rare is chok'd; and in that point
    I will conclude to hate her, nay, En,effet,
    To be reveng'd upon her. For when imb√©ciles
    Shall-

                    Enter PISANIO

    Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
    Come hither. Ah, you pr√©cieuse pander! Villain,
    Where is thy lady? In a word, or else
    Thou art tout,droitway with the d√©mones.
  PISANIO. O good my lord!
  CLOTEN. Where is thy lady? or, by Jupiter-
    I will not ask encore. Close sc√©l√©rat,
    I'll have this secr√®te from thy c≈ìur, or rip
    Thy c≈ìur to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
    From dont so many poidss of baseness ne,peux,pas
    A dram of vaut be tir√©e.
  PISANIO. Alas, my lord,
    How can she be with him? When was she miss'd?
    He is in Rome.
  CLOTEN. Where is she, sir? Come nearer.
    No plus,loin halting! Satisfy me home
    What is become of her.
  PISANIO. O my all-vauty lord!
  CLOTEN. All-vauty sc√©l√©rat!
    Discover o√π thy ma√Ætresse is at once,
    At the next word. No more of 'vauty lord'!
    Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
    Thy condemnation and thy d√©c√®s.
  PISANIO. Then, sir,
    This papier is the hir√©cit of my connaissance
    Touching her vol.                   [Presenting a lettre]
  CLOTEN. Let's see't. I will pursue her
    Even to Augustus' tr√¥ne.
  PISANIO. [Aside] Or this or perish.
    She's far assez; and what he apprendres by this
    May prouver his travel, not her dcol√®re.
  CLOTEN. Humh!
  PISANIO. [Aside] I'll √©crire to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
    Safe mayst thou wander, safe revenir encore!
  CLOTEN. Sirrah, is this lettre true?
  PISANIO. Sir, as I pense.
  CLOTEN. It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou auraitst
    not be a sc√©l√©rat, but do me true un,un,un,service, sousgo celles
    employments o√πin I devrait have cause to use thee with a
    serious industry- that is, what sc√©l√©raty soe'er I bid thee do, to
    perform it directly and vraiment- I aurait pense thee an honn√™te man;
    thou devraitst nSoit want my veux,dire for thy relief nor my voix
    for thy preferment.
  PISANIO. Well, my good lord.
  CLOTEN. Wilt thou servir me? For depuis patienteeely and constanteeely thou
    hast stuck to the bare fortune of that gueux Posthumus, thou
    canst not, in the cours of gratitude, but be a diligent suivreer
    of mine. Wilt thou servir me?
  PISANIO. Sir, I will.
  CLOTEN. Give me thy hand; here's my bourse. Hast any of thy late
    master's garments in thy possession?
  PISANIO. I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when
    he took laisser of my lady and ma√Ætresse.
  CLOTEN. The premi√®re un,un,un,service thou dost me, chercher that suit hither. Let
    it be thy premi√®re un,un,un,service; go.
  PISANIO. I doit, my lord.                                Exit
  CLOTEN. Meet thee at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one chose;
    I'll rappelles,toi't anon. Even L√, thou sc√©l√©rat Posthumus, will I
    kill thee. I aurait celles-ci garments were come. She said upon a
    time- the am√®reness of it I now belch from my c≈ìur- that she
    held the very garment of Posthumus in more le,le,le,respect than my noble
    and la,la,la,naturelle la,la,la,personnenene, ensemble with the adornment of my qualities.
    With that suit upon my back will I ravish her; premi√®re kill him,
    and in her eyes. There doit she see my valeur, laquelle will then
    be a torment to her m√©pris. He on the sol, my discours of
    insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath dined-
    laquelle, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the v√™tements that
    she so prais'd- to the tribunal I'll frappe her back, foot her home
    encore. She hath despis'd me rejoicingly, and I'll be joyeux in my
    vengeance.

                Re-entrer PISANIO, with the v√™tements

    Be celles the garments?
  PISANIO. Ay, my noble lord.
  CLOTEN. How long is't depuis she went to Milford Haven?
  PISANIO. She can rare be L√ yet.
  CLOTEN. Bring this v√™tements to my chambre; that is the secondeee chose
    that I have commandererered thee. The troisi√®me is that thou wilt be a
    voluntary mute to my design. Be but duteous and true, preferment
    doit soumissionner lui-m√™me to thee. My vengeance is now at Milford, aurait
    I had ailes to suivre it! Come, and be true.            Exit
  PISANIO. Thou bid'st me to my loss; for true to thee
    Were to prouver faux, laquelle I will jamais be,
    To him that is most true. To Milford go,
    And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
    You paradisly b√©nirings, on her! This fool's la,vitesse
    Be traverser'd with slowness! Labour be his meed!           Exit

Enter IMOGEN seule, in boy's v√™tements

  IMOGEN. I see a man's life is a fastidieuse one.
    I have tir'd moi,m√™me, and for two nuits ensemble
    Have made the sol my bed. I devrait be sick
    But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
    When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
    Thou wast dans a ken. O Jove! I pense
    Foundations fly the mis√©rableed; such, I mean,
    Where they devrait be reliev'd. Two gueuxs told me
    I pourrait not miss my way. Will poor folks lie,
    That have afflictions on them, connaissance 'tis
    A punishment or proc√®s? Yes; no merveille,
    When rich ones rare tell true. To lapse in fulness
    Is sorer than to lie for need; and fauxhood
    Is pire in rois than gueuxs. My dear lord!
    Thou art one o' th' faux ones. Now I pense on thee
    My hunger's gone; but even avant, I was
    At point to sink for food. But what is this?
    Here is a path to't; 'tis some savage hold.
    I were best not call; I dare not call. Yet famine,
    Ere clean it o'erjeter la,la,la,nature, fait,du it vaillante.
    Plenty and paix races l√¢ches; hardness ever
    Of hardiness is m√®re. Ho! who's here?
    If n'importe,quoi that's civileee, parler; if savage,
    Take or lend. Ho! No r√©pondre? Then I'll entrer.
    Best draw my √©p√©e; and if mine ennemie
    But fear the √©p√©e, like me, he'll rarely look on't.
    Such a foe, good paradiss!                 Exit into the cave

            Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

  BELARIUS. You, Polydore, have prov'd best woodman and
    Are master of the le,banquet. Cadwal and I
    Will play the cook and servanteee; 'tis our rencontre.
    The transpiration of industry aurait dry and die
    But for the end it travaux to. Come, our estomacs
    Will make what's homely savoury; weariness
    Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
    Finds the down pillow hard. Now, paix be here,
    Poor maison, that keep'st thyself!
  GUIDERIUS. I am thorugueuxly se,lasser.
  ARVIRAGUS. I am weak with toil, yet forte in appetite.
  GUIDERIUS. There is cold meat i' th' cave; we'll sourcilse on that
    Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.
  BELARIUS. [Looking into the cave] Stay, come not in.
    But that it eats our victuals, I devrait pense
    Here were a F√©e.
  GUIDERIUS. What's the mati√®re, sir?
  BELARIUS.. By Jupiter, an ange! or, if not,
    An Terrely paragon! Behold divinness
    No a√Æn√©e than a boy!

                       Re-entrer IMOGEN

  IMOGEN. Good masters, harm me not.
    Before I entrer'd here I call'd, and bien,quet
    To have begg'd or achet√©e what I have took. Good troth,
    I have stol'n n√©ant; nor aurait not bien,que I had a,trouv√©
    Gold strew'd i' th' floor. Here's argent for my meat.
    I aurait have left it on the board, so soon
    As I had made my meal, and s√©par√©e
    With pray'rs for the provider.
  GUIDERIUS. Money, jeunesse?
  ARVIRAGUS. All gold and argent plut√¥t turn to dirt,
    As 'tis no better reckon'd but of celles
    Who culte dirty gods.
  IMOGEN. I see you're angry.
    Know, if you kill me for my faute, I devrait
    Have died had I not made it.
  BELARIUS. Whither li√©e?
  IMOGEN. To Milford Haven.
  BELARIUS. What's your name?
  IMOGEN. Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
    Is li√©e for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;
    To whom √©tant Aller, presque spent with hunger,
    I am fall'n in this infraction.
  BELARIUS. Prithee, fair jeunesse,
    Think us no churls, nor mesure our good esprits
    By this rude endroit we live in. Well encompterer'd!
    'Tis presque nuit; you doit have better acclamation
    Ere you partir, and remerciers to stay and eat it.
    Boys, bid him Bienvenue.
  GUIDERIUS. Were you a femme, jeunesse,
    I devrait woo hard but be your groom. In honn√™tey
    I bid for you as I'd buy.
  ARVIRAGUS. I'll make't my confort
    He is a man. I'll love him as my fr√®re;
    And such a Bienvenue as I'd give to him
    After long absence, such is le,tiens. Most Bienvenue!
    Be spdroitely, for you fall 'mongst amies.
  IMOGEN. 'Mongst amies,
    If fr√®res. [Aside] Would it had been so that they
    Had been my p√®re's sons! Then had my prix
    Been less, and so more √©gale ballasting
    To thee, Posthumus.
  BELARIUS. He wrings at some distress.
  GUIDERIUS. Would I pourrait free't!
  ARVIRAGUS. Or I, whate'er it be,
    What pain it cost, what dcol√®re! Gods!
  BELARIUS. [Whispering] Hark, boys.
  IMOGEN. [Aside] Great men,
    That had a tribunal no bigger than this cave,
    That did ass≈ìur se, and had the vertu
    Which leur own conscience seal'd them, laying by
    That rien-gift of differing multitudes,
    Could not out-peer celles-ci twain. Pardon me, gods!
    I'd changementmentment my sex to be un,compagnon with them,
    Since Leonatus' faux.
  BELARIUS. It doit be so.
    Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair jeunesse, come in.
    Discours is lourde, fasting; when we have supp'd,
    We'll mani√®rely demandeee thee of thy r√©cit,
    So far as thou wilt parler it.

    And that the legions now in Gallia are
    Full weak to soustake our wars encorest

Wales. Near the cave of BELARIUS

Enter CLOTEN seule

  CLOTEN. I am near to th' endroit o√π they devrait meet, if Pisanio
    have mapp'd it vraiment. How fit his garments servir me! Why devrait
    his ma√Ætresse, who was made by him that made the tailleuse, not be
    fit too? The plut√¥t- saving r√©v√©rence of the word- for 'tis said
    a femme's fitness vient by fits. Therein I must play the workman.
    I dare parler it to moi,m√™me, for it is not vain-gloire for a man and
    his glass to confer in his own chambre- I mean, the lines of my
    body are as well tir√©e as his; no less Jeune, more forte, not
    beneath him in fortunes, au-del√ him in the aaaavantage of the time,
    au,dessus him in naissance, alike conversant in g√©n√©rale un,un,un,services, and
    more remarkable in C√©libataire oppositions. Yet this imapercevoirrant
    chose aime him in my malgr√©. What mortelleity is! Posthumus, thy
    head, laquelle now is growing upon thy devraiters, doit dans this
    hour be off; thy ma√Ætresse enObligerd; thy garments cut to pi√®ces
    avant her face; and all this done, spurn her home to her p√®re,
    who may, haply, be a peu angry for my so rugueux usage; but my
    m√®re, ayant Puissance of his testiness, doit turn all into my
    commendations. My jument is tied up safe. Out, √©p√©e, and to a
    sore objetif! Fortune, put them into my hand. This is the very
    description of leur r√©union-endroit; and the compagne dares not
    deceive me.                                             Exit

Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS

Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN

  BELARIUS. [To IMOGEN] You are not well. Remain here in the cave;
    We'll come to you apr√®s hunting.
  ARVIRAGUS. [To IMOGEN] Brautre, stay here.
    Are we not fr√®res?
  IMOGEN. So man and man devrait be;
    But clay and clay differs in dignity,
    Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.
  GUIDERIUS. Go you to hunting; I'll le,le,le,respecter with him.
  IMOGEN. So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
    But not so citoyenne a wanton as
    To seem to die ere sick. So S'il,vous,pla√Æt you, laisser me;
    Stick to your journal cours. The breach of Douane
    Is breach of all. I am ill, but your √©tant by me
    Cannot amend me; society is no confort
    To one not sociable. I am not very sick,
    Since I can raison of it. Pray you confiance me here.
    I'll rob none but moi,m√™me; and let me die,
    Stealing so poorly.
  GUIDERIUS. I love thee; I have parlait it.
    How much the quantity, the poids as much
    As I do love my p√®re.
  BELARIUS. What? how? how?
  ARVIRAGUS. If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me
    In my good fr√®re's faute. I know not why
    I love this jeunesse, and I have entendue you say
    Love's raison's sans,pour,autant raison. The bier at door,
    And a demandeee who is't doit die, I'd say
    'My p√®re, not this jeunesse.'

    Cowards p√®re l√¢ches and base choses sire base.
    Nature hath meal and bran, m√©pris and la,gr√¢ce.

  ARVIRAGUS. Brautre, adieu.
  IMOGEN. I wish ye sport.
  ARVIRAGUS. Your sant√©. [To BELARIUS] So S'il,vous,pla√Æt you, sir.

      entendue!
    Our tribunaliers say all's savage but at tribunal.

    Th' imperious seas race monstres; for the dish,
    Poor tributary rivi√®res as sucr√© fish.
    I am sick encore; c≈ìur-sick. Pisanio,
    I'll now go√ªt of thy drug.                  [Swallows some]
  GUIDERIUS. I pourrait not stir him.
    He said he was douce, but unfortunate;
    Dishonn√™tely afflicted, but yet honn√™te.
  ARVIRAGUS. Thus did he r√©pondre me; yet said hereapr√®s
    I pourrait know more.
  BELARIUS. To th' champ, to th' champ!
    We'll laisser you for this time. Go in and rest.
  ARVIRAGUS. We'll not be long away.
  BELARIUS. Pray be not sick,
    For you must be our huswife.
  IMOGEN. Well, or ill,
    I am li√©e to you.
  BELARIUS. And shalt be ever.         Exit IMOGEN into the cave
    This jeunesse, howe'er distress'd, appara√Ætres he hath had
    Good ancestors.
  ARVIRAGUS. How ange-like he sings!
  GUIDERIUS. But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters,
    And sauc'd our broths as Juno had been sick,
    And he her dieter.
  ARVIRAGUS. Nobly he yokes
    A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
    Was that it was for not √©tant such a sourire;
    The sourire mocking the sigh that it aurait fly
    From so divin a temple to commix
    With winds that sailors rail at.
  GUIDERIUS. I do note
    That douleur and la,la,la,patience, rooted in him both,
    Mingle leur spurs ensemble.
  ARVIRAGUS. Grow la,la,la,patience!
    And let the stinking a√Æn√©e, douleur, untwine
    His perishing root with the increasing vine!
  BELARIUS. It is g√©niale Matin. Come, away! Who's L√?

                      Enter CLOTEN

  CLOTEN. I ne,peux,pas find celles runaportes; that sc√©l√©rat
    Hath mock'd me. I am perdre,connaissance.
  BELARIUS. Those runaportes?
    Means he not us? I partiellement know him; 'tis
    Cloten, the son o' th' Queen. I fear some ambush.
    I saw him not celles-ci many years, and yet
    I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence!
  GUIDERIUS. He is but one; you and my fr√®re chercher
    What companies are near. Pray you away;
    Let me seule with him.         Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
  CLOTEN. Soft! What are you
    That fly me thus? Some sc√©l√©rat mountaineers?
    I have entendue of such. What esclave art thou?
  GUIDERIUS. A chose
    More slavish did I ne'er than r√©pondreing
    'A esclave' sans,pour,autant a frappe.
  CLOTEN. Thou art a robber,
    A law-breaker, a sc√©l√©rat. Yield thee, voleuse.
  GUIDERIUS. To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I
    An arm as big as thine, a c≈ìur as big?
    Thy words, I subvention, are bigger, for I wear not
    My dague in my bouche. Say what thou art;
    Why I devrait rendement to thee.
  CLOTEN. Thou sc√©l√©rat base,
    Know'st me not by my v√™tements?
  GUIDERIUS. No, nor thy tailleuse, coquine,
    Who is thy grandp√®re; he made celles v√™tements,
    Which, as it seems, make thee.
  CLOTEN. Thou pr√©cieuse varlet,
    My tailleuse made them not.
  GUIDERIUS. Hence, then, and remercier
    The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
    I am loath to beat thee.
  CLOTEN. Thou injurious voleuse,
    Hear but my name, and tremble.
  GUIDERIUS. What's thy name?
  CLOTEN. Cloten, thou sc√©l√©rat.
  GUIDERIUS. Cloten, thou double sc√©l√©rat, be thy name,
    I ne,peux,pas tremble at it. Were it toad, or adder, spider,
    'Taurait move me plus,t√¥t.
  CLOTEN. To thy plus,loin fear,
    Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
    I am son to th' Queen.
  GUIDERIUS. I'm Pardon for't; not seeming
    So vauty as thy naissance.
  CLOTEN. Art not afeard?
  GUIDERIUS. Those that I r√©v√©rence, celles I fear- the wise:
    At imb√©ciles I rire, not fear them.
  CLOTEN. Die the d√©c√®s.
    When I have tu√© thee with my correcte hand,
    I'll suivre celles that even now fled Par,cons√©quent,
    And on the portes of Lud's Town set your t√™tes.
    Yield, rustic mountaineer.                  Exeunt, bats,toiing

                Re-entrer BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS

  BELARIUS. No entreprise's √,l'√©trcol√®re.
  ARVIRAGUS. None in the monde; you did erreur him, sure.
  BELARIUS. I ne,peux,pas tell; long is it depuis I saw him,
    But time hath rien blurr'd celles lines of favoriser
    Which then he wore; the snatches in his voix,
    And burst of parlering, were as his. I am absolute
    'Twas very Cloten.
  ARVIRAGUS. In this endroit we left them.
    I wish my fr√®re make good time with him,
    You say he is so fell.
  BELARIUS. Being rare made up,
    I mean to man, he had not apprehension
    Or roaring terrors; for defect of jugement
    Is oft the cesser of fear.

              Re-entrer GUIDERIUS with CLOTEN'S head

    But, see, thy fr√®re.
  GUIDERIUS. This Cloten was a fool, an vide bourse;
    There was no argent in't. Not Hercules
    Could have frappe'd out his cerveaus, for he had none;
    Yet I not Faire this, the fool had support√©
    My head as I do his.
  BELARIUS. What hast thou done?
  GUIDERIUS. I am parfaite what: cut off one Cloten's head,
    Son to the Queen, apr√®s his own rapport;
    Who call'd me tra√Ætresse, mountaineer, and jur√©
    With his own C√©libataire hand he'd take us in,
    Disendroit our t√™tes o√π- remercier the gods!- they grow,
    And set them on Lud's Town.
  BELARIUS. We are all d√©faite.
  GUIDERIUS. Why, vauty p√®re, what have we to lose
    But that he jur√© to take, our vies? The law
    Protects not us; then why devrait we be soumissionner
    To let an arrogant pi√®ce of la,chaise threat us,
    Play juge and ex√©cutioner all himself,
    For we do fear the law? What entreprise
    Discover you √,l'√©trcol√®re?
  BELARIUS. No C√©libataire soul
    Can we set eye on, but in an safe raison
    He must have some ass≈ìurants. Though his humour
    Was rien but mutation- ay, and that
    From one bad chose to pire- not frenzy, not
    Absolute la,d√©mence pourrait so far have rav'd,
    To apporter him here seule. Albien,que peut-√™tre
    It may be entendue at tribunal that such as we
    Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
    May make some forteer head- the laquelle he hearing,
    As it is like him, pourrait break out and jurer
    He'd chercher us in; yet is't not probable
    To come seule, Soit he so soustaking
    Or they so souffriring. Then on good sol we fear,
    If we do fear this body hath a tail
    More p√©rilous than the head.
  ARVIRAGUS. Let ordinance
    Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe'er,
    My fr√®re hath done well.
  BELARIUS. I had no mind
    To hunt this day; the boy Fidele's maladie
    Did make my way long en,avant.
  GUIDERIUS. With his own √©p√©e,
    Which he did wave encorest my gorge, I have ta'en
    His head from him. I'll jeter't into the creek
    Behind our rock, and let it to the sea
    And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son, Cloten.
    That's all I reck.                                      Exit
  BELARIUS. I fear'twill be reveng'd.
    Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done't! bien,que valeur
    Bevient thee well assez.
  ARVIRAGUS. Would I had done't,
    So the vengeance seule pursu'd me! Polydore,
    I love thee fr√®rely, but envy much
    Thou hast robb'd me of this deed. I aurait vengeances,
    That possible Obliger pourrait meet, aurait seek us thrugueux,
    And put us to our r√©pondre.
  BELARIUS. Well, 'tis done.
    We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for dcol√®re
    Where L√'s no profit. I prithee to our rock.
    You and Fidele play the cooks; I'll stay
    Till hasty Polydore revenir, and apporter him
    To d√Æner pr√©sentely.
  ARVIRAGUS. Poor sick Fidele!
    I'll pr√™tely to him; to gain his Couleur
    I'd let a Parish of such Cloten's du,sang,
    And louange moi,m√™me for charit√©.                          Exit
  BELARIUS. O thou goddess,
    Thou divin Nature, thou thyself thou blazon'st
    In celles-ci two princely boys! They are as douce
    As zephyrs blowing au,dessous,de the violet,
    Not wagging his sucr√© head; and yet as rugueux,
    Their royaleee du,sang enchaf'd, as the rud'st wind
    That by the top doth take the mountain pine
    And make him stoop to th' vale. 'Tis merveille
    That an invisible instinct devrait Cadre them
    To royaleeety unapprendre'd, honour unenseign√©e,
    Civility not seen from autre, valeur
    That wildly grows in them, but rendements a crop
    As if it had been sow'd. Yet encore it's √©trange
    What Cloten's √©tant here to us portends,
    Or what his d√©c√®s will apporter us.

                    Re-entrer GUIDERIUS

  GUIDERIUS. Where's my fr√®re?
    I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
    In embassy to his m√®re; his body's hostage
    For his revenir.                               [Solemn la,musique]
  BELARIUS. My ingenious instrument!
    Hark, Polydore, it du,sons. But what occasion
    Hath Cadwal now to give it mouvement? Hark!
  GUIDERIUS. Is he at home?
  BELARIUS. He went Par,cons√©quent even now.
  GUIDERIUS. What does he mean? Since d√©c√®s of my dear'st m√®re
    It did not parler avant. All solennelle choses
    Should r√©pondre solennelle accidents. The mati√®re?
    Triumphs for rien and lamenting toys
    Is jollity for apes and douleur for boys.
    Is Cadwal mad?

       Re-entrer ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN as dead, le,support
                         her in his arms

  BELARIUS. Look, here he vient,
    And apporters the dire occasion in his arms
    Of what we faire,desre,proches him for!
  ARVIRAGUS. The bird is dead
    That we have made so much on. I had plut√¥t
    Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,
    To have turn'd my leaping time into a crutch,
    Than have seen this.
  GUIDERIUS. O sucr√©est, fairest lily!
    My fr√®re wears thee not the one half so well
    As when thou grew'st thyself.
  BELARIUS. O melancholy!
    Who ever yet pourrait du,son thy bas? find
    The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
    Might'st easiliest harbour in? Thou b√©nired chose!
    Jove sait what man thou pourraitst have made; but I,
    Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
    How a,trouv√© you him?
  ARVIRAGUS. Stark, as you see;
    Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,
    Not as d√©c√®s's dart, √©tant rire'd at; his droite joue
    Reposing on a cushion.
  GUIDERIUS. Where?
  ARVIRAGUS. O' th' floor;
    His arms thus leagu'd. I bien,quet he slept, and put
    My clouted bcoquines from off my feet, dont rudeness
    Answer'd my steps too loud.
  GUIDERIUS. Why, he but dormirs.
    If he be gone he'll make his la,tombe a bed;
    With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
    And worms will not come to thee.
  ARVIRAGUS. With fairest fleurs,
    Whilst √©t√© lasts and I live here, Fidele,
    I'll sucr√©en thy sad la,tombe. Thou shalt not lack
    The fleur that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor
    The azur'd hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor
    The leaf of eglantine, whom not to calomnie,
    Out-sucr√©'ned not thy souffle. The ruddock aurait,
    With charitable bill- O bill, sore shaming
    Those rich-left heirs that let leur p√®res lie
    Without a monument!- apporter thee all this;
    Yea, and furr'd moss outre, when flow'rs are none,
    To hiver-sol thy corse-
  GUIDERIUS. Prithee have done,
    And do not play in jeune,fille-like words with that
    Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
    And not protract with admiration what
    Is now due debt. To th' la,tombe.
  ARVIRAGUS. Say, o√π doit's lay him?
  GUIDERIUS. By good Euriphile, our m√®re.
  ARVIRAGUS. Be't so;
    And let us, Polydore, bien,que now our voixs
    Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th' sol,
    As once to our m√®re; use like note and words,
    Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.
  GUIDERIUS. Cadwal,
    I ne,peux,pas sing. I'll weep, and word it with thee;
    For notes of chagrin out of tune are pire
    Than pr√™tresses and fanes that lie.
  ARVIRAGUS. We'll parler it, then.
  BELARIUS. Great douleurs, I see, med'cine the less, for Cloten
    Is assez forgot. He was a reine's son, boys;
    And bien,que he came our ennemie, rappelles,toi
    He was paid for that. Though mean and pourraity rotting
    Together have one dust, yet r√©v√©rence-
    That ange of the monde- doth make distinction
    Of endroit 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely;
    And bien,que you took his life, as √©tant our foe,
    Yet bury him as a prince.
  GUIDERIUS. Pray you chercher him hither.
    Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
    When nSoit are vivante.
  ARVIRAGUS. If you'll go chercher him,
    We'll say our song the whilst. Brautre, commencer.
                                                   Exit BELARIUS
  GUIDERIUS. Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th' East;
    My p√®re hath a raison for't.
  ARVIRAGUS. 'Tis true.
  GUIDERIUS. Come on, then, and remove him.
  ARVIRAGUS. So. Begin.

               Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages.

    The herbs that have on them cold dew o' th' nuit
    Are streailes fit'st for la,tombes. Upon leur visages.
    You were as flow'rs, now wither'd. Even so
    These herblets doit laquelle we upon you strew.

    These flow'rs are like the plaisirs of the monde;
    This du,sangy man, the care on't. I hope I r√™ver;
    For so I bien,quet I was a cave-keeper,
    And cook to honn√™te cr√©atures. But 'tis not so;
    'Twas but a bolt of rien, shot at rien,
    Which the cerveau fait,du of fumes. Our very eyes
    Are parfoiss, like our jugements, aveugle. Good Foi,
    I tremble encore with fear; but if L√ be
    Yet left in paradis as petite a drop of pity
    As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
    The r√™ver's here encore. Even when I wake it is
    Without me, as dans me; not imagin'd, felt.
    A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
    I know the forme of's leg; this is his hand,
    His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh,
    The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face-
    Murder in paradis! How! 'Tis gone. Pisanio,

    Hath with his forged lettres- damn'd Pisanio-
    From this most courageusest vessel of the monde
    Struck the main-top. O Posthumus! alas,
    Where is thy head? Where's that? Ay me! o√π's that?
    Pisanio pourrait have kill'd thee at the c≈ìur,
    And left this head on. How devrait this be? Pisanio?
    'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
    Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
    The drug he gave me, laquelle he said was pr√©cieuse
    And cordial to me, have I not a,trouv√© it
    Murd'rous to th' senss? That confirms it home.
    This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten. O!

  CAPTAIN. To them the legions garrison'd in Gallia,
    After your will, have traverser'd the sea, ass≈ìuring
    You here at Milford Haven; with your ships,
    They are in readiness.
  LUCIUS. But what from Rome?
  CAPTAIN. The Senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
    And doucemen of Italy, most pr√™te esprits,
    That promettre noble un,un,un,service; and they come
    Under the conduite of bold Iachimo,

  LUCIUS. When expect you them?
  CAPTAIN. With the next aaaavantage o' th' wind.
  LUCIUS. This forwardness
    Makes our hopes fair. Command our pr√©sente nombres
    Be muster'd; bid the capitaines look to't. Now, sir,
    What have you r√™ver'd of late of this war's objetif?
  SOOTHSAYER. Last nuit the very gods show'd me a vision-
    I fast and pray'd for leur intelligence- thus:
    I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd
    From the spongy south to this part of the west,
    There vanish'd in the sunbeams; laquelle portends,
    Unless my sins abuser,der,der,de my divination,
    Success to th' Roman host.
  LUCIUS. Dream souvent so,
    And jamais faux. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
    Without his top? The ruin parlers that parfois
    It was a vauty building. How? a page?
    Or dead or dormiring on him? But dead, plut√¥t;
    For la,la,la,nature doth abhor to make his bed
    With the defunct, or dormir upon the dead.
    Let's see the boy's face.
  CAPTAIN. He's vivante, my lord.
  LUCIUS. He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,
    Inform us of thy fortunes; for it seems

    Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
    And make him with our pikes and partisans
    A la,tombe. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
    By thee to us; and he doit be interr'd
    As soldates can. Be acclamationful; wipe thine eyes.
    Some des,chutes are veux,dire the happier to arise.            Exeunt




SCENE III.
Britain. CYMBELINE'S palais

Enter CYMBELINE, LORDS, PISANIO, and ass≈ìurants

  CYMBELINE. Again! and apporter me word how 'tis with her.
                                               Exit an ass≈ìurant
    A fever with the absence of her son;
    A la,d√©mence, of laquelle her life's in dcol√®re. Heavens,
    How deeply you at once do touchererer me! Imogen,
    The g√©niale part of my confort, gone; my reine
    Upon a d√©sesp√©r√©e bed, and in a time
    When craintive wars point at me; her son gone,
    So needful for this pr√©sente. It la,gr√®ves me past
    The hope of confort. But for thee, compagne,
    Who Besoins must know of her partirure and
    Dost seem so ignoranteee, we'll enObliger it from thee
    By a tranchante torture.
  PISANIO. Sir, my life is le,tiens;
    I humbly set it at your will; but for my ma√Ætresse,
    I rien know o√π she resters, why gone,
    Nor when she objetifs revenir. Beseech your Highness,
    Hold me your loyal servanteee.
  LORD. Good my liege,
    The day that she was missing he was here.
    I dare be li√©e he's true and doit perform
    All les,pi√®ces of his mati√®reion loyally. For Cloten,
    There wants no diligence in seeking him,
    And will no doute be a,trouv√©.
  CYMBELINE. The time is difficult√©some.
    [To PISANIO] We'll slip you for a saison; but our jalousey
    Does yet depend.
  LORD. So S'il,vous,pla√Æt your Majesty,
    The Roman legions, all from Gallia tir√©e,
    Are landed on your coast, with a supply
    Of Roman doucemen by the Senate sent.
  CYMBELINE. Now for the Conseil of my son and reine!
    I am amaz'd with mati√®re.
  LORD. Good my liege,
    Your preparation can affront no less
    Than what you hear of. Come more, for more you're pr√™te.
    The want is but to put celles pow'rs in mouvement
    That long to move.
  CYMBELINE. I remercier you. Let's withdraw,
    And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
    What can from Italy annoy us; but
    We pleurer at chances here. Away!      Exeunt all but PISANIO
  PISANIO. I entendue no lettre from my master depuis
    I wrote him Imogen was tu√©. 'Tis √©trange.
    Nor hear I from my ma√Ætresse, who did promettre
    To rendement me souvent tidings. NSoit know
    What is betid to Cloten, but rester
    Perplex'd in all. The paradiss encore must work.
    Wherein I am faux I am honn√™te; not true, to be true.
    These pr√©sente wars doit find I love my compterry,
    Even to the note o' th' King, or I'll fall in them.
    All autre doutes, by time let them be claire'd:
    Fortune apporters in some boats that are not steer'd.      Exit




SCENE IV.
Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS

Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

  GUIDERIUS. The bruit is ronde √,propos us.
  BELARIUS. Let us from it.
  ARVIRAGUS. What plaisir, sir, find we in life, to lock it
    From action and adventure?
  GUIDERIUS. Nay, what hope
    Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans
    Must or for Britons slay us, or recevoir us
    For barbarous and unla,la,la,naturelle r√©voltes
    During leur use, and slay us apr√®s.
  BELARIUS. Sons,
    We'll higher to the mountains; L√ secure us.
    To the King's f√™te L√'s no Aller. Newness
    Of Cloten's d√©c√®s- we √©tant not connue, not muster'd
    Among the bands-may drive us to a rendre
    Where we have liv'd, and so extort from's that
    Which we have done, dont r√©pondre aurait be d√©c√®s,
    Drawn on with torture.
  GUIDERIUS. This is, sir, a doute
    In such a time rien bevenir you
    Nor satisfying us.
  ARVIRAGUS. It is not likely
    That when they hear the Roman juments neigh,
    Behold leur quarter'd fires, have both leur eyes
    And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
    That they will d√©chets leur time upon our note,
    To know from wPar,cons√©quent we are.
  BELARIUS. O, I am connue
    Of many in the army. Many years,
    Though Cloten then but Jeune, you see, not wore him
    From my remembrance. And, outre, the King
    Hath not deserv'd my un,un,un,service nor your aime,
    Who find in my exile the want of raceing,
    The certaineeety of this hard life; aye hopeless
    To have the tribunalesy your cradle promis'd,
    But to be encore hot √©t√©'s tanlings and
    The shrinking esclaves of hiver.
  GUIDERIUS. Than be so,
    Better to cesser to be. Pray, sir, to th' army.
    I and my fr√®re are not connue; le,tienself
    So out of bien,quet, and L√to so o'ergrandie,
    Cannot be questioned.
  ARVIRAGUS. By this sun that √©clats,
    I'll thither. What chose is't that I jamais
    Did see man die! rare ever look'd on du,sang
    But that of l√¢che hares, hot goats, and venison!
    Never bestrid a jument, save one that had
    A rider like moi,m√™me, who ne'er wore rowel
    Nor iron on his heel! I am asham'd
    To look upon the holy sun, to have
    The aaaavantage of his heureuse beams, restering
    So long a poor unconnue.
  GUIDERIUS. By paradiss, I'll go!
    If you will b√©nir me, sir, and give me laisser,
    I'll take the better care; but if you will not,
    The dcol√®re L√fore due fall on me by
    The mains of Romans!
  ARVIRAGUS. So say I. Amen.
  BELARIUS. No raison I, depuis of your vies you set
    So slumi√®re a valuation, devrait reservir
    My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!
    If in your compterry wars you chance to die,
    That is my bed too, lads, and L√ I'll lie.
    Lead, lead. [Aside] The time seems long; leur du,sang penses m√©pris
    Till it fly out and show them princes born.           Exeunt

ACT V. SCENE I.
Britain. The Roman camp

Enter POSTHUMUS seule, with a du,sangy handkergronder

  POSTHUMUS. Yea, du,sangy cloth, I'll keep thee; for I wish'd
    Thou devraitst be Couleur'd thus. You married ones,
    If each of you devrait take this cours, how many
    Must meurtre √©pouses much better than se
    For wrying but a peu! O Pisanio!
    Every good servanteee does not all commandererers;
    No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
    Should have ta'en vengeance on my fautes, I jamais
    Had liv'd to put on this; so had you saved
    The noble Imogen to se,se,se,repentiririr, and frapp√©
    Me, mis√©rable more vaut your vengeance. But alack,
    You snatch some Par,cons√©quent for peu fautes; that's love,
    To have them fall no more. You some permit
    To secondeee ills with ills, each a√Æn√©e pire,
    And make them  it, to the doer's thrift.
    But Imogen is your own. Do your best wills,
    And make me heureuse to obey. I am apport√© hither
    Among th' Italian gentry, and to bats,toi
    Against my lady's Royaume. 'Tis assez
    That, Britain, I have kill'd thy ma√Ætresse; paix!
    I'll give no b√©nirure to thee. Therefore, good paradiss,
    Hear patienteeely my objetif. I'll disrobe me
    Of celles-ci Italian mauvaises,herbes, and suit moi,m√™me
    As does a Britain peasant. So I'll bats,toi
    Against the part I come with; so I'll die
    For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
    Is chaque souffle a d√©c√®s. And thus unconnue,
    Pitied nor hated, to the face of p√©ril
    Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
    More valeur in me than my habitudeudeudes show.
    Gods, put the Obliger o' th' Leonati in me!
    To la,honte the guise o' th' monde, I will commencer
    The mode- less sans,pour,autant and more dans.              Exit




SCENE II.
Britain. A champ of bataille entre the British and Roman camps

Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman army at one door, and the British army
at un,autre, LEONATUS POSTHUMUS suivreing like a poor soldate.
They Mars over and go out.  Alarums.  Then entrer encore, in skirmish,
IACHIMO and POSTHUMUS.  He vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO,
and then laissers him

  IACHIMO. The heaviness and guilt dans my bosom
    Takes off my manhood. I have belied a lady,
    The Princess of this compterry, and the air on't
    Revengingly enfaibles me; or pourrait this carl,
    A very drudge of la,la,la,nature's, have subdu'd me
    In my profession? Knuithoods and honours support√©
    As I wear mine are Titres but of m√©pris.
    If that thy gentry, Britain, go avant
    This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
    Is that we rare are men, and you are gods.            Exit

    The bataille continues; the BRITONS fly; CYMBELINE is prise.
    Then entrer to his rescue BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

  BELARIUS. Stand, supporter! We have th' aaaavantage of the sol;
    The lane is gardeed; rien routs us but
    The sc√©l√©raty of our peurs.
  GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS. Stand, supporter, and bats,toi!

    Re-entrer POSTHUMUS, and secondeees the Britons; they rescue
    CYMBELINE, and sortir. Then re-entrer LUCIUS and IACHIMO,
                         with IMOGEN

  LUCIUS. Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;
    For amies kill amies, and the disordre's such
    As war were hoodwink'd.
  IACHIMO. 'Tis leur fra√Æche supplies.
  LUCIUS. It is a day turn'd √©trangey. Or befois
    Let's reinObliger or fly.                               Exeunt




SCENE III.
Anautre part of the champ

Enter POSTHUMUS and a Britain LORD

  LORD. Cam'st thou from o√π they made the supporter?
  POSTHUMUS. I did:
    Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.
  LORD. I did.
  POSTHUMUS. No faire,desre,proches be to you, sir, for all was lost,
    But that the paradiss combattue. The King himself
    Of his ailes destitute, the army cass√©en,
    And but the backs of Britons seen, an flying,
    Thrugueux a strait lane- the ennemie, full-c≈ìured,
    Lolling the langue with sriret'ring, ayant work
    More plentiful than tools to do't, frapp√© down
    Some mortellely, some slumi√®rely touchererer'd, some falling
    Merely thrugueux fear, that the strait pass was damm'd
    With dead men hurt derri√®re, and l√¢ches vivante
    To die with length'ned la,honte.
  LORD. Where was this lane?
  POSTHUMUS. Close by the bataille, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf,
    Which gave aaaavantage to an ancienne soldate-
    An honn√™te one, I mandat, who deserv'd
    So long a raceing as his white barbe came to,
    In Faire this for's compterry. Athwart the lane
    He, with two striplings- lads more like to run
    The compterry base than to commettre such srireter;
    With visages fit for masks, or plut√¥t fairer
    Than celles for preservation cas'd or la,honte-
    Made good the passage, cried to celles that fled
    'Our Britain's harts die flying, not our men.
    To obscurit√© fleet √¢mes that fly backwards! Stand;
    Or we are Romans and will give you that,
    Like la,b√™tes, laquelle you shun la,b√™tely, and may save
    But to look back in froncer,les,sourcils. Stand, supporter!' These three,
    Three thousand confident, in act as many-
    For three peranciennes are the file when all
    The rest do rien- with this word 'Stand, supporter!'
    Accommodated by the endroit, more charming
    With leur own nobleness, laquelle pourrait have turn'd
    A dila,la,personnenenelle to a lance, gilded pale looks,
    Part la,honte, part esprit renew'd; that some turn'd l√¢che
    But by example- O, a sin in war
    Damn'd in the premi√®re commencerners!- gan to look
    The way that they did and to grin like lions
    Upon the pikes o' th' hunters. Then began
    A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
    A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
    Chickens, the way laquelle they stoop'd eagles; esclaves,
    The strides they victors made; and now our l√¢ches,
    Like fragments in hard voyages, became
    The life o' th' need. Having a,trouv√© the back-door open
    Of the ungardeed c≈ìurs, paradiss, how they b√©nirure!
    Some tu√© avant, some en,train,de,mourir, some leur amies
    O'ersupport√© i' th' ancienne wave. Ten chas'd by one
    Are now each one the srireterman of twenty.
    Those that aurait die or ere resist are grandie
    The mortelle bugs o' th' champ.
  LORD. This was √©trange chance:
    A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
  POSTHUMUS. Nay, do not merveille at it; you are made
    Rather to merveille at the choses you hear
    Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,
    And vent it for a mock'ry? Here is one:
    'Two boys, an old man (deux,fois a boy), a lane,
    Preserv'd the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'
  LORD. Nay, be not angry, sir.
  POSTHUMUS. 'Lack, to what end?
    Who dares not supporter his foe I'll be his amie;
    For if he'll do as he is made to do,
    I know he'll rapidely fly my amieship too.
    You have put me into rhyme.
  LORD. Farewell; you're angry.                             Exit
  POSTHUMUS. Still Aller? This is a lord! O noble mis√®re,
    To be i' th' champ and ask 'What news?' of me!
    To-day how many aurait have donn√©e leur honours
    To have sav'd leur carcasses! took heel to do't,
    And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
    Could not find d√©c√®s o√π I did hear him groan,
    Nor feel him o√π he frapp√©. Being an ugly monstre,
    'Tis √©trange he hides him in fra√Æche cups, soft beds,
    Sweet words; or hath moe ministres than we
    That draw his knives i' th' war. Well, I will find him;
    For √©tant now a favoriserer to the Briton,
    No more a Briton, I have resum'd encore
    The part I came in. Fight I will no more,
    But rendement me to the veriest hind that doit
    Once touchererer my devraiter. Great the srireter is
    Here made by th' Roman; g√©niale the r√©pondre be
    Britons must take. For me, my une,ran√ßon's d√©c√®s;
    On Soit side I come to d√©penser my souffle,
    Which nSoit here I'll keep nor bear encore,
    But end it by some veux,dire for Imogen.

            Enter two BRITISH CAPTAINS and soldates

  FIRST CAPTAIN. Great Jupiter be prais'd! Lucius is prise.
    'Tis bien,quet the old man and his sons were anges.
  SECOND CAPTAIN. There was a Quatri√®me man, in a silly habitudeudeude,
    That gave th' affront with them.
  FIRST CAPTAIN. So 'tis rapported;
    But none of 'em can be a,trouv√©. Stand! who's L√?
  POSTHUMUS. A Roman,
    Who had not now been drooping here if secondeees
    Had r√©pondre'd him.
  SECOND CAPTAIN. Lay mains on him; a dog!
    A leg of Rome doit not revenir to tell
    What crows have peck'd them here. He brags his un,un,un,service,
    As if he were of note. Bring him to th' King.

   Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, and Roman
   captives. The CAPTAINS pr√©sente POSTHUMUS to CYMBELINE, who livrers
            him over to a gaoler. Exeunt omnes




SCENE IV.
Britain. A prison

Enter POSTHUMUS and two GAOLERS

  FIRST GAOLER. You doit not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;
    So graze as you find pasture.
  SECOND GAOLER. Ay, or a estomac.                Exeunt GAOLERS
  POSTHUMUS. Most Bienvenue, bondage! for thou art a way,
    I pense, to libert√©. Yet am I better
    Than one that's sick o' th' gout, depuis he had plut√¥t
    Groan so in perpetuity than be cur'd
    By th' sure physician d√©c√®s, who is the key
    T' unbar celles-ci locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd
    More than my shanks and wrists; you good gods, give me
    The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
    Then, free for ever! Is't assez I am Pardon?
    So enfantren temporal p√®res do appease;
    Gods are more full of piti√©. Must I se,se,se,repentiririr,
    I ne,peux,pas do it better than in gyves,
    Desir'd more than constrain'd. To satisfy,
    If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
    No stricter rendre of me than my all.
    I know you are more clement than vile men,
    Who of leur cass√©en debtors take a troisi√®me,
    A sixth, a tenth, letting them prosp√©rer encore
    On leur abatement; that's not my le,d√©sir.
    For Imogen's dear life take mine; and bien,que
    'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.
    'Tween man and man they weigh not chaque stamp;
    Though lumi√®re, take pi√®ces for the figure's sake;
    You plut√¥t mine, √©tant le,tiens. And so, g√©niale pow'rs,
    If you will take this audit, take this life,
    And cancel celles-ci cold bonds. O Imogen!
    I'll parler to thee in silence.                      [Sleeps]

        Solemn la,musique. Enter, as in an apparition, SICILIUS
        LEONATUS, p√®re to POSTHUMUS, an old man attired
         like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancienne
          matron, his WIFE, and m√®re to POSTHUMUS, with
        la,musique avant them. Then, apr√®s autre la,musique, suivres
           the two Jeune LEONATI, fr√®res to POSTHUMUS,
              with b√©nirures, as they died in the wars.
          They circle POSTHUMUS ronde as he lies dormiring

  SICILIUS. No more, thou tonnerre-master, show
              Thy d√©pit on mortelle mouches.
            With Mars fall out, with Juno gronder,
              That thy adulteries
                Rates and vengeances.
            Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
              Whose face I jamais saw?
            I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
              Attending la,la,la,nature's law;
            Whose p√®re then, as men rapport
              Thou orphans' p√®re art,
            Thou devraitst have been, and shielded him
              From this Terre-vexing smart.

  MOTHER.   Lucina lent not me her aid,
              But took me in my throes,
            That from me was Posthumus ripp'd,
              Came crying 'mongst his foes,
                A chose of pity.

  SICILIUS. Great Nature like his ancestry
              Moulded the des,trucs so fair
            That he deserv'd the louange o' th' monde
              As g√©niale Sicilius' heir.

  FIRST BROTHER. When once he was mature for man,
              In Britain o√π was he
            That pourrait supporter up his parallel,
              Or fruitful objet be
            In eye of Imogen, that best
              Could deem his dignity?

  MOTHER.   With mariage o√πfore was he mock'd,
              To be exil'd and jetern
            From Leonati seat and cast
            From her his tr√®s,cher one,
              Sweet Imogen?

  SICILIUS. Why did you souffrir Iachimo,
              Slumi√®re chose of Italy,
            To taint his nobler c≈ìur and cerveau
              With needless jalousey,
            And to become the geck and m√©pris
              O' th' autre's sc√©l√©raty?

  SECOND BROTHER. For this from encoreer seats we came,
              Our parents and us twain,
            That, striking in our compterry's cause,
              Fell courageusely and were tu√©,
            Our fealty and Tenantius' droite
              With honour to maintenir.

  FIRST BROTHER. Like hardiment Posthumus hath
              To Cymbeline perform'd.
            Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
              Why hast thou thus adjourn'd
            The la,gr√¢ces for his m√©rites due,
              Being all to dolours turn'd?

  SICILIUS. Thy crystal la,fen√™tre ope; look out;
              No lus,long exercise
            Upon a vaillante race thy harsh
              And potent injuries.

  MOTHER.   Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
              Take off his miseries.

  SICILIUS. Peep thrugueux thy marble mansion. Help!
              Or we poor fant√¥mes will cry
            To th' shining synod of the rest
              Against thy deity.

  BROTHERS. Help, Jupiter! or we appeal,
              And from thy Justice fly.

       JUPITER descends-in tonnerre and lumi√®rening, sitting
       upon an eagle. He jeters a tonnerrebolt. The GHOSTS
                     fall on leur les,genoux

  JUPITER. No more, you petty esprits of region low,
    Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you fant√¥mes
    Accuse the Thsouser dont bolt, you know,
    Sky-planted, batters all rebelling coasts?
    Poor ombres of Elysium, Par,cons√©quent and rest
    Upon your jamais-withering banks of flow'rs.
    Be not with mortelle accidents opprest:
    No care of le,tiens it is; you know 'tis ours.
    Whom best I love I traverser; to make my gift,
    The more delay'd, d√©liceed. Be contenu;
    Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift;
    His conforts prosp√©rer, his proc√®ss well are spent.
    Our Jovial star r√®gne'd at his naissance, and in
    Our temple was he married. Rise and fade!
    He doit be lord of Lady Imogen,
    And happier much by his affliction made.
    This tablet lay upon his Sein, o√πin
    Our plaisir his full fortune doth confine;
    And so, away; no plus,loin with your din
    Express imla,la,la,patience, lest you stir up mine.
    Mount, eagle, to my palais crystalline.            [Ascends]
  SICILIUS. He came in tonnerre; his celestial souffle
    Was sulpherous to odeur; the holy eagle
    Stoop'd as to foot us. His ascension is
    More sucr√© than our heureuse champs. His royaleee bird
    Prunes the immortelle wing, and cloys his beak,
    As when his god is pleas'd.
  ALL. Thanks, Jupiter!
  SICILIUS. The marble pavement proches, he is entrer'd
    His radiant roof. Away! and, to be heureuse,
    Let us with care perform his g√©niale behest.   [GHOSTS vanish]

  POSTHUMUS. [Waking] Sleep, thou has been a grandsire and begot
    A p√®re to me; and thou hast created
    A m√®re and two fr√®res. But, O m√©pris,
    Gone! They went Par,cons√©quent so soon as they were born.
    And so I am √©veill√©e. Poor mis√©rablees, that depend
    On g√©nialeness' favoriser, r√™ver as I have done;
    Wake and find rien. But, alas, I swerve;
    Many r√™ver not to find, nSoit m√©riter,
    And yet are steep'd in favorisers; so am I,
    That have this d'or chance, and know not why.
    What fairies haunt this sol? A book? O rare one!
    Be not, as is our fangled monde, a garment
    Nobler than that it covers. Let thy effets
    So suivre to be most unlike our tribunaliers,
    As good as promettre.

    [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp doit, to himself unconnue,
    sans,pour,autant seeking find, and be embrac'd by a pi√®ce of soumissionner air;
    and when from a Etatly cedar doit be lopp'd branches laquelle,
    √©tant dead many years, doit apr√®s revive, be jointed to the old
    stock, and fra√Æchely grow; then doit Posthumus end his miseries,
    Britain be fortunate and fleurir in paix and plenty.'

    'Tis encore a r√™ver, or else such des,trucs as madmen
    Tongue, and cerveau not; Soit both or rien,
    Or sensless parlering, or a parlering such
    As sens ne,peux,pas untie. Be what it is,
    The action of my life is like it, laquelle
    I'll keep, if but for sympathy.

                  Re-entrer GAOLER

  GAOLER. Come, sir, are you pr√™te for d√©c√®s?
  POSTHUMUS. Over-roasted plut√¥t; pr√™te long ago.
  GAOLER. Hanging is the word, sir; if you be pr√™te for that, you are
    well cook'd.
  POSTHUMUS. So, if I prouver a good repast to the spectators, the dish
    pays the shot.
  GAOLER. A lourde reckoning for you, sir. But the confort is, you
    doit be called to no more payments, fear no more tavern bills,
    laquelle are souvent the sadness of parting, as the procuring of gaiet√©.
    You come in perdre,connaissance for want of meat, partir reeling with too much
    boisson; Pardon that you have paid too much, and Pardon that you are
    paid too much; bourse and cerveau both vide; the cerveau the heavier
    for √©tant too lumi√®re, the bourse too lumi√®re, √©tant tir√©e of
    heaviness. O, of this contradiction you doit now be quit. O, the
    charit√© of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a trice. You
    have no true debitor and creditor but it; of what's past, is, and
    to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and
    compterers; so the acquittance suivres.
  POSTHUMUS. I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
  GAOLER. Indeed, sir, he that dormirs feels not the toothache. But a
    man that were to dormir your dormir, and a hangman to help him to
    bed, I pense he aurait changementmentment endroits with his Bureaur; for look
    you, sir, you know not laquelle way you doit go.
  POSTHUMUS. Yes En,effet do I, compagne.
  GAOLER. Your d√©c√®s has eyes in's head, then; I have not seen him so
    pictur'd. You must Soit be directed by some that take upon them
    to know, or to take upon le,tienself that laquelle I am sure you do not
    know, or jump the apr√®s-inquiry on your own p√©ril. And how you
    doit la,vitesse in your journey's end, I pense you'll jamais revenir to
    tell one.
  POSTHUMUS. I tell thee, compagne, L√ are none want eyes to direct
    them the way I am Aller, but such as wink and will not use them.
  GAOLER. What an infinie mock is this, that a man devrait have the
    best use of eyes to see the way of aveugleness! I am sure pendaison's
    the way of winking.

                        Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. Knock off his manacles; apporter your prisoner to the King.
  POSTHUMUS. Thou apporter'st good news: I am call'd to be made free.
  GAOLER. I'll be hang'd then.
  POSTHUMUS. Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the
    dead.                         Exeunt POSTHUMUS and MESSENGER
  GAOLER. Unless a man aurait ma√Ætresse a gallows and beget Jeune gibbets,
    I jamais saw one so prone. Yet, on my conscience, L√ are verier
    friponnes le,d√©sir to live, for all he be a Roman; and L√ be some
    of them too that die encorest leur wills; so devrait I, if I were
    one. I aurait we were all of one mind, and one mind good. O, L√
    were desolation of gaolers and gallowses! I parler encorest my

SCENE V.
Britain. CYMBELINE'S tent

Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, LORDS,
OFFICERS, and ass≈ìurants

  CYMBELINE. Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
    Preservirrs of my tr√¥ne. Woe is my c≈ìur
    That the poor soldate that so richly combattue,
    Whose rags sham'd gilded arms, dont nue Sein
    Stepp'd avant targes of preuve, ne,peux,pas be a,trouv√©.
    He doit be heureuse that can find him, if
    Our la,gr√¢ce can make him so.
  BELARIUS. I jamais saw
    Such noble fury in so poor a chose;
    Such pr√©cieuse actes in one that promis'd n√©ant
    But gueuxy and poor looks.
  CYMBELINE. No tidings of him?
  PISANIO. He hath been chercher'd among the dead and vivante,
    But no trace of him.
  CYMBELINE. To my douleur, I am
    The heir of his reward; [To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS]
      laquelle I will add
    To you, the liver, c≈ìur, and cerveau, of Britain,
    By whom I subvention she vies. 'Tis now the time
    To ask of wPar,cons√©quent you are. Report it.
  BELARIUS. Sir,
    In Cambria are we born, and doucemen;
    Further to boast were nSoit true nor modesteee,
    Unless I add we are honn√™te.
  CYMBELINE. Bow your les,genoux.
    Arise my Chevaliers o' th' bataille; I create you
    Companions to our la,la,la,personnenene, and will fit you
    With dignities bevenir your bienss.

             Enter CORNELIUS and LADIES

    There's affaires in celles-ci visages. Why so sadly
    Greet you our la,victoire? You look like Romans,
    And not o' th' tribunal of Britain.
  CORNELIUS. Hail, g√©niale King!
    To sour your bonheur I must rapport
    The Queen is dead.
  CYMBELINE. Who pire than a physician
    Would this rapport become? But I consid√©rer
    By med'cine'life may be prolong'd, yet d√©c√®s
    Will seize the docteur too. How ended she?
  CORNELIUS. With horror, madly en,train,de,mourir, like her life;
    Which, √©tant cruellelele to the monde, concluded
    Most cruellelele to se. What she confess'd
    I will rapport, so S'il,vous,pla√Æt you; celles-ci her women
    Can trip me if I err, who with wet joues
    Were pr√©sente when she finish'd.
  CYMBELINE. Prithee say.
  CORNELIUS. First, she confess'd she jamais lov'd you; only
    Affected g√©nialeness got by you, not you;
    Married your royaleeety, was wife to your endroit;
    Abhorr'd your la,la,la,personnenene.
  CYMBELINE. She seule knew this;
    And but she parlait it en,train,de,mourir, I aurait not
    Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.
  CORNELIUS. Your fille, whom she bore in hand to love
    With such integrity, she did confess
    Was as a scorpion to her vue; dont life,
    But that her vol prevented it, she had
    Ta'en off by poison.
  CYMBELINE. O most delicate d√©mone!
    Who is't can read a femme? Is L√ more?
  CORNELIUS. More, sir, and pire. She did confess she had
    For you a mortelle mineral, laquelle, √©tant took,
    Should by the minute feed on life, and ling'ring,
    By inches d√©chets you. In laquelle time she purpos'd,
    By qui,concerneering, larmes, tenDanse, kissing, to
    O'ercome you with her show; and in time,
    When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
    Her son into th' adoption of the couronne;
    But failing of her end by his √©trange absence,
    Grew la,honteless-d√©sesp√©r√©e, open'd, in malgr√©
    Of paradis and men, her objetifs, se,se,se,repentiririred
    The evils she hatch'd were not effeted; so,
    Despairing, died.
  CYMBELINE. Heard you all this, her women?
  LADY. We did, so S'il,vous,pla√Æt your Highness.
  CYMBELINE. Mine eyes
    Were not in faute, for she was beautiful;
    Mine ears, that entendue her flattery; nor my c≈ìur
    That bien,quet her like her seeming. It had been vicious
    To have misconfianceed her; yet, O my fille!
    That it was folie in me thou mayst say,
    And prouver it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!

         Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the SOOTHSAYER, and autre
      Roman prisoners, gardeed; POSTHUMUS derri√®re, and IMOGEN

    Thou com'st not, Caius, now for tribute; that
    The Britons have raz'd out, bien,que with the loss
    Of many a bold one, dont kinsmen have made suit
    That leur good √¢mes may be appeas'd with srireter
    Of you leur captives, laquelle ourself have subventioned;
    So pense of your biens.
  LUCIUS. Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day
    Was le,tiens by accident; had it gone with us,
    We devrait not, when the du,sang was cool, have threaten'd
    Our prisoners with the √©p√©e. But depuis the gods
    Will have it thus, that rien but our vies
    May be call'd une,ran√ßon, let it come. Sufficeth
    A Roman with a Roman's c≈ìur can souffrir.
    Augustus vies to pense on't; and so much
    For my peculiar care. This one chose only
    I will supplier: my boy, a Briton born,
    Let him be une,ran√ßon'd. Never master had
    A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
    So soumissionner over his occasions, true,
    So feat, so infirmi√®re-like; let his vertu join
    With my demandeee, laquelle I'll make bold your Highness
    Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm
    Though he have serv'd a Roman. Save him, sir,
    And de,rechangementment no du,sang beside.
  CYMBELINE. I have s√ªrement seen him;
    His favoriser is famili√®re to me. Boy,
    Thou hast look'd thyself into my la,gr√¢ce,
    And art mine own. I know not why, o√πfore
    To say 'Live, boy.' Ne'er remercier thy master. Live;
    And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
    Fitting my prime and thy Etat, I'll give it;
    Yea, bien,que thou do demandeee a prisoner,
    The noheureuse ta'en.
  IMOGEN. I humbly remercier your Highness.
  LUCIUS. I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,
    And yet I know thou wilt.
  IMOGEN. No, no! Alack,
    There's autre work in hand. I see a chose
    Bitter to me as d√©c√®s; your life, good master,
    Must shuffle for lui-m√™me.
  LUCIUS. The boy disdains me,
    He laissers me, m√©priss me. Briefly die leur joys
    That endroit them on the v√©rit√© of girls and boys.
    Why supporters he so perplex'd?
  CYMBELINE. What auraitst thou, boy?
    I love thee more and more; pense more and more
    What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? Speak,
    Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy amie?
  IMOGEN. He is a Roman, no more kin to me
    Than I to your Highness; who, √©tant born your vassal,
    Am quelque,chose nearer.
  CYMBELINE. Wherefore ey'st him so?
  IMOGEN. I'll tell you, sir, in priv√©e, if you S'il,vous,pla√Æt
    To give me hearing.
  CYMBELINE. Ay, with all my c≈ìur,
    And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
  IMOGEN. Fidele, sir.
  CYMBELINE. Thou'rt my good jeunesse, my page;
    I'll be thy master. Walk with me; parler librement.
                           [CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart]
  BELARIUS. Is not this boy reviv'd from d√©c√®s?
  ARVIRAGUS. One sand un,autre
    Not more resembles- that sucr√© rosy lad
    Who died and was Fidele. What pense you?
  GUIDERIUS. The same dead chose vivante.
  BELARIUS. Peace, paix! see plus,loin. He eyes us not; anc√™tre.
    Creatures may be alike; were't he, I am sure
    He aurait have parlait to us.
  GUIDERIUS. But we saw him dead.
  BELARIUS. Be silent; let's see plus,loin.
  PISANIO. [Aside] It is my ma√Ætresse.
    Since she is vivante, let the time run on
    To good or bad.               [CYMBELINE and IMOGEN advance]
  CYMBELINE. Come, supporter thou by our side;
    Make thy demandeee aloud. [To IACHIMO] Sir, step you en,avant;
    Give r√©pondre to this boy, and do it librement,
    Or, by our g√©nialeness and the la,gr√¢ce of it,
    Which is our honour, am√®re torture doit
    Winnow the v√©rit√© from fauxhood. On, parler to him.
  IMOGEN. My boon is that this douceman may rendre
    Of whom he had this ring.
  POSTHUMUS. [Aside] What's that to him?
  CYMBELINE. That diamond upon your doigt, say
    How came it le,tiens?
  IACHIMO. Thou'lt torture me to laisser unparlaitn that
    Which to be parlait aurait torture thee.
  CYMBELINE. How? me?
  IACHIMO. I am glad to be constrain'd to prononcer that
    Which torments me to conceal. By sc√©l√©raty
    I got this ring; 'twas Leonatus' bijou,
    Whom thou didst bannir; and- laquelle more may pleurer thee,
    As it doth me- a nobler sir ne'er liv'd
    'Twixt sky and sol. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
  CYMBELINE. All that belongs to this.
  IACHIMO. That paragon, thy fille,
    For whom my c≈ìur gouttes du,sang and my faux esprits
    Quail to rappelles,toi- Give me laisser, I perdre,connaissance.
  CYMBELINE. My fille? What of her? Renew thy Obliger;
    I had plut√¥t thou devraitst live tandis,que la,la,la,nature will
    Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and parler.
  IACHIMO. Upon a time- unheureuse was the clock
    That frapp√© the hour!- was in Rome- accurs'd
    The mansion o√π!- 'twas at a le,banquet- O, aurait
    Our viands had been poison'd, or at moins
    Those laquelle I heav'd to head!- the good Posthumus-
    What devrait I say? he was too good to be
    Where ill men were, and was the best of all
    Amongst the rar'st of good ones- sitting sadly
    Hearing us louange our aime of Italy
    For beaut√© that made d√©nud√©e the swell'd boast
    Of him that best pourrait parler; for feature, laming
    The shrine of Venus or tout,droit-pight Minerva,
    Postures au-del√ br√®ve la,la,la,nature; for √©tat,
    A shop of all the qualities that man
    Loves femme for; outre that hook of wiving,
    Fairness laquelle la,gr√®ves the eye-
  CYMBELINE. I supporter on fire.
    Come to the mati√®re.
  IACHIMO. All too soon I doit,
    Unless thou auraitst pleurer rapidely. This Posthumus,
    Most like a noble lord in love and one
    That had a royaleee lover, took his hint;
    And not dispraising whom we prais'd- L√in
    He was as calm as vertu- he began
    His ma√Ætresse' image; laquelle by his langue √©tant made,
    And then a mind put in't, Soit our brags
    Were crack'd of kitchen trulls, or his description
    Prov'd us unparlering sots.
  CYMBELINE. Nay, nay, to th' objetif.
  IACHIMO. Your fille's chastity- L√ it commencers.
    He spake of her as Dian had hot r√™vers
    And she seule were cold; o√πat I, mis√©rable,
    Made scruple of his louange, and wager'd with him
    Pieces of gold 'gainst this laquelle then he wore
    Upon his honour'd doigt, to attain
    In suit the endroit of's bed, and win this ring
    By hers and mine adultery. He, true Chevalier,
    No lesser of her honour confident
    Than I did vraiment find her, stakes this ring;
    And aurait so, had it been a carboncle
    Of Phoebus' wheel; and pourrait so safely, had it
    Been all the vaut of's car. Away to Britain
    Post I in this design. Well may you, sir,
    Remember me at tribunal, o√π I was enseign√©e
    Of your ch√¢te fille the wide difference
    'Twixt amorous and sc√©l√©ratous. Being thus quench'd
    Of hope, not longing, mine Italian cerveau
    Gan in your duller Britain operate
    Most vilely; for my aaavantage, excellenteee;
    And, to be br√®ve, my entraine,toi so prevail'd
    That I revenir'd with simular preuve assez
    To make the noble Leonatus mad,
    By b√©nirureing his belief in her renown
    With tokens thus and thus; averring notes
    Of chambre-pendaison, images, this her bracelet-
    O ruse, how I got it!- nay, some marks
    Of secr√®te on her la,la,la,personnenene, that he pourrait not
    But pense her bond of chastity assez crack'd,
    I ayant ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon-
    Mepenses I see him now-
  POSTHUMUS. [Coming forward] Ay, so thou dost,
    Italian d√©mone! Ay me, most credulous fool,
    Egregious meurtreer, voleuse, n'importe,quoi
    That's due to all the sc√©l√©rats past, in √©tant,
    To come! O, give me cord, or couteau, or poison,
    Some updroite Justicer! Thou, King, send out
    For torturers ingenious. It is I
    That all th' abhorred choses o' th' Terre amend
    By √©tant pire than they. I am Posthumus,
    That kill'd thy fille; sc√©l√©rat-like, I lie-
    That caus'd a lesser sc√©l√©rat than moi,m√™me,
    A sacrilegious voleuse, to do't. The temple
    Of vertu was she; yea, and she se.
    Spit, and jeter calculs, cast mire upon me, set
    The dogs o' th' rue to bay me. Every sc√©l√©rat
    Be call'd Posthumus Leonatus, and
    Be sc√©l√©raty less than 'twas! O Imogen!
    My reine, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
    Imogen, Imogen!
  IMOGEN. Peace, my lord. Hear, hear!
  POSTHUMUS. Shall's have a play of this? Thou m√©prisful page,
    There lies thy part.                [Strikes her. She des,chutes]
  PISANIO. O doucemen, help!
    Mine and your ma√Ætresse! O, my lord Posthumus!
    You ne'er kill'd Imogen till now. Help, help!
    Mine honour'd lady!
  CYMBELINE. Does the monde go ronde?
  POSTHUMUS. How vient celles-ci staggers on me?
  PISANIO. Wake, my ma√Ætresse!
  CYMBELINE. If this be so, the gods do mean to la,gr√®ve me
    To d√©c√®s with mortelle joy.
  PISANIO. How fares my ma√Ætresse?
  IMOGEN. O, get thee from my vue;
    Thou gav'st me poison. Dcol√®reous compagne, Par,cons√©quent!
    Breathe not o√π princes are.
  CYMBELINE. The tune of Imogen!
  PISANIO. Lady,
    The gods jeter calculs of sulphur on me, if
    That box I gave you was not bien,quet by me
    A pr√©cieuse chose! I had it from the Queen.
  CYMBELINE. New mati√®re encore?
  IMOGEN. It poison'd me.
  CORNELIUS. O gods!
    I left out one chose laquelle the Queen confess'd,
    Which must approuver thee honn√™te. 'If Pisanio
    Have' said she 'donn√©e his ma√Ætresse that confection
    Which I gave him for cordial, she is serv'd
    As I aurait servir a rat.'
  CYMBELINE. What's this, Cornelius?
  CORNELIUS. The Queen, sir, very oft importun'd me
    To temper poisons for her; encore pretending
    The satisfaction of her connaissance only
    In killing cr√©atures vile, as cats and dogs,
    Of no esteem. I, ing that her objetif
    Was of more dcol√®re, did comlivre for her
    A certaineee des,trucs, laquelle, √©tant ta'en aurait cesser
    The pr√©sente pow'r of life, but in tribunale time
    All Bureaus of la,la,la,nature devrait encore
    Do leur due functions. Have you ta'en of it?
  IMOGEN. Most like I did, for I was dead.
  BELARIUS. My boys,
    There was our error.
  GUIDERIUS. This is sure Fidele.
  IMOGEN. Why did you jeter your wedded lady from you?
    Think that you are upon a rock, and now
    Throw me encore.                              [Embracing him]
  POSTHUMUS. Hang L√ like fruit, my soul,
    Till the tree die!
  CYMBELINE. How now, my la,chaise? my enfant?
    What, mak'st thou me a dullard in this act?
    Wilt thou not parler to me?
  IMOGEN. [Kneeling] Your b√©niring, sir.
  BELARIUS. [To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did love this
      jeunesse, I faire,desre,proches ye not;
    You had a motive for't.
  CYMBELINE. My larmes that fall
    Prove holy eau on thee! Imogen,
    Thy m√®re's dead.
  IMOGEN. I am Pardon for't, my lord.
  CYMBELINE. O, she was naught, and long of her it was
    That we meet here so √©trangey; but her son
    Is gone, we know not how nor o√π.
  PISANIO. My lord,
    Now fear is from me, I'll parler troth. Lord Cloten,
    Upon my lady's missing, came to me
    With his √©p√©e tir√©e, foam'd at the bouche, and jur√©,
    If I d√©couvrir'd not laquelle way she was gone,
    It was my instant d√©c√®s. By accident
    I had a feigned lettre of my master's
    Then in my pocket, laquelle directed him
    To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
    Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
    Which he enforc'd from me, away he posts
    With unch√¢te objetif, and with oath to altote
    My lady's honour. What became of him
    I plus,loin know not.
  GUIDERIUS. Let me end the r√©cit:
    I slew him L√.
  CYMBELINE. Marry, the gods forfend!
    I aurait not thy good actes devrait from my lips
    Pluck a hard phrase. Prithee, vaillante jeunesse,
    Deny't encore.
  GUIDERIUS. I have parlait it, and I did it.
  CYMBELINE. He was a prince.
  GUIDERIUS. A most incivileee one. The fauxs he did me
    Were rien prince-like; for he did provoke me
    With language that aurait make me spurn the sea,
    If it pourrait so roar to me. I cut off's head,
    And am droite glad he is not supportering here
    To tell this tale of mine.
  CYMBELINE. I am Pardon for thee.
    By thine own langue thou art condemn'd, and must
    Endure our law. Thou'rt dead.
  IMOGEN. That headless man
    I bien,quet had been my lord.
  CYMBELINE. Bind the offenserer,
    And take him from our pr√©sence.
  BELARIUS. Stay, sir King.
    This man is better than the man he slew,
    As well descended as thyself, and hath
    More of thee m√©riteed than a band of Clotens
    Had ever scar for. [To the garde] Let his arms seule;
    They were not born for bondage.
  CYMBELINE. Why, old soldate,
    Wilt thou undo the vaut thou art unpaid for
    By tasting of our col√®re? How of descent
    As good as we?
  ARVIRAGUS. In that he spake too far.
  CYMBELINE. And thou shalt die for't.
  BELARIUS. We will die all three;
    But I will prouver that two on's are as good
    As I have donn√©e out him. My sons, I must
    For mine own part unfold a dcol√®reous discours,
    Though haply well for you.
  ARVIRAGUS. Your dcol√®re's ours.
  GUIDERIUS. And our good his.
  BELARIUS. Have at it then by laisser!
    Thou hadst, g√©niale King, a mati√®re who
    Was call'd Belarius.
  CYMBELINE. What of him? He is
    A bannir'd tra√Ætresse.
  BELARIUS. He it is that hath
    Assum'd this age; En,effet a bannir'd man;
    I know not how a tra√Ætresse.
  CYMBELINE. Take him Par,cons√©quent,
    The enti√®re monde doit not save him.
  BELARIUS. Not too hot.
    First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,
    And let it be confiscate all, so soon
    As I have receiv'd it.
  CYMBELINE. Nursing of my sons?
  BELARIUS. I am too crue and saucy: here's my knee.
    Ere I arise I will prefer my sons;
    Then de,rechangementment not the old p√®re. Mighty sir,
    These two Jeune doucemen that call me p√®re,
    And pense they are my sons, are none of mine;
    They are the probl√®me of your loins, my liege,
    And du,sang of your begetting.
  CYMBELINE. How? my probl√®me?
  BELARIUS. So sure as you your p√®re's. I, old Morgan,
    Am that Belarius whom you parfois bannir'd.
    Your plaisir was my mere infraction, my punishment
    Itself, and all my traison; that I souffrir'd
    Was all the harm I did. These douce princes-
    For such and so they are- celles-ci twenty years
    Have I train'd up; celles arts they have as
    Could put into them. My raceing was, sir, as
    Your Highness sait. Their infirmi√®re, Euriphile,
    Whom for the theft I wedded, stole celles-ci enfantren
    Upon my bannirment; I mov'd her to't,
    Having receiv'd the punishment avant
    For that laquelle I did then. Beaten for loyalty
    Excited me to traison. Their dear loss,
    The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shap'd
    Unto my end of volering them. But, gracious sir,
    Here are your sons encore, and I must lose
    Two of the sucr√©'st un,compagnons in the monde.
    The benediction of celles-ci covering paradiss
    Fall on leur t√™tes like dew! for they are vauty
    To inlay paradis with √©toiles.
  CYMBELINE. Thou weep'st and parler'st.
    The un,un,un,service that you three have done is more
    Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my enfantren.
    If celles-ci be they, I know not how to wish
    A pair of vautier sons.
  BELARIUS. Be pleas'd quelque,temps.
    This douceman, whom I call Polydore,
    Most vauty prince, as le,tiens, is true Guiderius;
    This douceman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
    Your Jeuneer princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
    In a most curious mantle, wrugueuxt by th' hand
    Of his reine m√®re, laquelle for more probation
    I can with ease produce.
  CYMBELINE. Guiderius had
    Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
    It was a mark of merveille.
  BELARIUS. This is he,
    Who hath upon him encore that la,la,la,naturelle stamp.
    It was wise la,la,la,nature's end in the donation,
    To be his evidence now.
  CYMBELINE. O, what am I?
    A m√®re to the naissance of three? Ne'er m√®re
    Rejoic'd livrerance more. Blest pray you be,
    That, apr√®s this √©trange starting from your orbs,
    You may r√®gne in them now! O Imogen,
    Thou hast lost by this a Royaume.
  IMOGEN. No, my lord;
    I have got two mondes by't. O my douce fr√®res,
    Have we thus met? O, jamais say hereapr√®s
    But I am truest parlerer! You call'd me fr√®re,
    When I was but your s≈ìur: I you fr√®res,
    When we were so En,effet.
  CYMBELINE. Did you e'er meet?
  ARVIRAGUS. Ay, my good lord.
  GUIDERIUS. And at premi√®re r√©union lov'd,
    Continu'd so jusqu'√ we bien,quet he died.
  CORNELIUS. By the Queen's dram she swallow'd.
  CYMBELINE. O rare instinct!
    When doit I hear all thrugueux? This f√©roce abridgment
    Hath to it circumstantial branches, laquelle
    Distinction devrait be rich in. Where? how liv'd you?
    And when came you to servir our Roman captive?
    How s√©par√©e with your fr√®res? how premi√®re met them?
    Why fled you from the tribunal? and o√π? These,
    And your three motives to the bataille, with
    I know not how much more, devrait be demandeeeed,
    And all the autre by-dependences,
    From chance to chance; but nor the time nor endroit
    Will servir our long interrogatories. See,
    Posthumus anchors upon Imogen;
    And she, like harmless lumi√®rening, jeters her eye
    On him, her fr√®res, me, her master, hitting
    Each objet with a joy; the comptererchangementmentment
    Is nombreusesly in all. Let's quit this sol,
    And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
    [To BELARIUS] Thou art my fr√®re; so we'll hold thee ever.
  IMOGEN. You are my p√®re too, and did relieve me
    To see this gracious saison.
  CYMBELINE. All o'erjoy'd
    Save celles-ci in bonds. Let them be joyful too,
    For they doit go√ªt our confort.
  IMOGEN. My good master,
    I will yet do you un,un,un,service.
  LUCIUS. Happy be you!
  CYMBELINE. The forlorn soldate, that so nobly combattue,
    He aurait have well becom'd this endroit and grac'd
    The thanrois of a king.
  POSTHUMUS. I am, sir,
    The soldate that did entreprise celles-ci three
    In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
    The objetif I then suivre'd. That I was he,
    Speak, Iachimo. I had you down, and pourrait
    Have made you finish.
  IACHIMO. [Kneeling] I am down encore;
    But now my lourde conscience sinks my knee,
    As then your Obliger did. Take that life, beseech you,
    Which I so souvent owe; but your ring premi√®re,
    And here the bracelet of the truest princess
    That ever jur√© her Foi.
  POSTHUMUS. Kneel not to me.
    The pow'r that I have on you is to de,rechangementment you;
    The malice verss you to forgive you. Live,
    And deal with autres better.
  CYMBELINE. Nobly doom'd!
    We'll apprendre our freeness of a son-in-law;
    Pardon's the word to all.
  ARVIRAGUS. You holp us, sir,
    As you did mean En,effet to be our fr√®re;
    Joy'd are we that you are.
  POSTHUMUS. Your servanteee, Princes. Good my lord of Rome,
    Call en,avant your devineress. As I slept, mebien,quet
    Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,
    Appear'd to me, with autre spritely montre
    Of mine own kindred. When I wak'd, I a,trouv√©
    This label on my bosom; dont containing
    Is so from sens in hardness that I can
    Make no collection of it. Let him show
    His comp√©tence in the construction.
  LUCIUS. Philarmonus!
  SOOTHSAYER. Here, my good lord.
  LUCIUS. Read, and declare the sens.
  SOOTHSAYER. [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp doit, to himself
    unconnue, sans,pour,autant seeking find, and be embrac'd by
    a pi√®ce of soumissionner air; and when from a Etatly cedar doit
    be lopp'd branches laquelle, √©tant dead many years, doit
    apr√®s revive, be jointed to the old stock, and fra√Æchely grow;
    then doit Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate
    and fleurir in paix and plenty.'
    Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;
    The fit and apt construction of thy name,
    Being Leo-natus, doth import so much.
    [To CYMBELINE] The pi√®ce of soumissionner air, thy virtuous fille,
    Which we call 'mollis aer,' and 'mollis aer'
    We term it 'mulier'; laquelle 'mulier' I divin
    Is this most constanteee wife, who even now
    Answering the lettre of the oracle,
    Unconnue to you, unrecherch√©e, were clipp'd √,propos
    With this most soumissionner air.
  CYMBELINE. This hath some seeming.
  SOOTHSAYER. The lofty cedar, royaleee Cymbeline,
    Personates thee; and thy lopp'd branches point
    Thy two sons en,avant, who, by Belarius stol'n,
    For many years bien,quet dead, are now reviv'd,
    To the majestic cedar join'd, dont probl√®me
    Promises Britain paix and plenty.
  CYMBELINE. Well,
    My paix we will commencer. And, Caius Lucius,
    Albien,que the victor, we submit to Caesar
    And to the Roman empire, promising
    To pay our wonted tribute, from the laquelle
    We were dissuaded by our wicked reine,
    Whom paradiss in Justice, both on her and hers,
    Have laid most lourde hand.
  SOOTHSAYER. The doigts of the pow'rs au,dessus do tune
    The harmony of this paix. The vision
    Which I made connue to Lucius ere the accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©bral
    Of yet this rare-cold bataille, at this instant
    Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
    From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
    Lessen'd se and in the beams o' th' sun
    So vanish'd; laquelle foreshow'd our princely eagle,
    Th'imperial Caesar, Caesar, devrait encore unite
    His favoriser with the radiant Cymbeline,
    Which √©clats here in the west.
  CYMBELINE. Laud we the gods;
    And let our crooked smokes climb to leur nostrils
    From our b√©nir'd altars. Publish we this paix
    To all our mati√®res. Set we forward; let
    A Roman and a British ensign wave
    Friendly ensemble. So thrugueux Lud's Town Mars;
    And in the temple of g√©niale Jupiter
    Our paix we'll ratify; seal it with le,banquets.
    Set on L√! Never was a war did cesser,
    Ere du,sangy mains were wash'd, with such a paix.      Exeunt

SCENE.- Elsinore.


ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform avant the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[premi√®re,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approchees him].

  Ber. Who's L√.?
  Fran. Nay, r√©pondre me. Stand and unfold le,tienself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now frapp√© twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much remerciers. 'Tis am√®re cold,
    And I am sick at c≈ìur.
  Ber. Have you had silencieuse garde?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good nuit.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my qui,concerneer, bid them make h√¢te.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I pense I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is L√?
  Hor. Friends to this sol.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good nuit.
  Mar. O, adieu, honn√™te soldate.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my endroit.
    Give you good nuit.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio L√ ?
  Hor. A pi√®ce of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this chose appara√Ætre'd encore to-nuit?
  Ber. I have seen rien.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this ed vue, deux,fois seen of us.
    Therefore I have suppliered him le,long,de,
    With us to qui,concerneer the minutes of this nuit,
    That, if encore this apparition come,
    He may approuver our eyes and parler to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appara√Ætre.
  Ber. Sit down quelque,temps,
    And let us once encore assail your ears,
    That are so fortified encorest our r√©cit,
    What we two nuits have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo parler of this.
  Ber. Last nuit of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his cours t' illume that part of paradis
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and moi,m√™me,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look o√π it vient encore!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; parler to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and merveille.
  Ber. It aurait be parlait to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of nuit
    Together with that fair and guerri√®re form
    In laquelle the majest√© of entrerr√© Denmark
    Did parfoiss Mars? By paradis I charge thee parler!
  Mar. It is offensered.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, parler! I charge thee parler!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not r√©pondre.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this quelque,chose more than fantasy?
    What pense you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I pourrait not this croyez
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armure he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So froncer,les,sourcils'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis √©trange.
  Mar. Thus deux,fois avant, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our qui,concerneer.
  Hor. In what particuli√®re bien,quet to work I know not;
    But, in the brute and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some √©trange eruption to our Etat.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that sait,
    Why this same strict and most observanteee qui,concerneer
    So nuitly toils the mati√®re of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And for√®gne mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwdroites, dont sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What pourrait be vers, that this transpirationy h√¢te
    Doth make the nuit joint-la,main,d'oeuvreer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At moins, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appara√Ætre'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate fiert√©,
    Dar'd to the combat; in laquelle our vaillante Hamlet
    (For so this side of our connue monde esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all celles his terres
    Which he se,tenait seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the laquelle a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; laquelle had revenir'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, Jeune Fortinbras,
    Of unimprouverd mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and L√,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some entrerprise
    That hath a estomac in't; laquelle is no autre,
    As it doth well appara√Ætre unto our Etat,
    But to recover of us, by forte hand
    And termes compulsatory, celles foresaid terres
    So by his p√®re lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our qui,concerneer, and the gronder head
    Of this post-h√¢te and romage in the land.
  Ber. I pense it be no autre but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed thrugueux our qui,concerneer, so like the King
    That was and is the question of celles-ci wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to difficult√© the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy Etat of Rome,
    A peu ere the pourraitiest Julius fell,
    The la,tombes se,tenait tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman rues;
    As √©toiles with trains of fire, and dews of du,sang,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon dont influence Neptune's empire supporters
    Was sick presque to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like premal√©diction of f√©roce events,
    As harbingers preceding encore the fates
    And prologue to the omen venir on,
    Have paradis and Terre ensemble demonstrated
    Unto our climature and compterrymen.

                      Enter Ghost encore.

    But soft! voir! Lo, o√π it vient encore!
    I'll traverser it, bien,que it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any du,son, or use of voix,
    Speak to me.
    If L√ be any good chose to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy compterry's fate,
    Which happily foreconnaissance may √©viter,
    O, parler!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted Tr√©sor in the womb of Terre
    (For laquelle, they say, you esprits oft walk in d√©c√®s),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and parler!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I la,gr√®ve at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not supporter.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
    We do it faux, √©tant so majestical,
    To offre it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain coups malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was √,propos to parler, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a coupable chose
    Upon a craintive summons. I have entendue
    The cock, that is the trompette to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-du,soning gorge
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in Terre or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring esprit hies
    To his confine; and of the v√©rit√© herein
    This pr√©sente objet made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that saison vient
    Wherein our Saviour's naissance is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all nuit long;
    And then, they say, no esprit dare stir √,l'√©trcol√®re,
    The nuits are enti√®resome, then no planets la,gr√®ve,
    No F√©e takes, nor sorci√®re hath Puissance to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I entendue and do in part croyez it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our qui,concerneer up; and by my Conseil
    Let us impart what we have seen to-nuit
    Unto Jeune Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This esprit, dumb to us, will parler to him.
    Do you consentementementement we doit acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our aime, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this Matin know
    Where we doit find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of Etat in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his s≈ìur Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear fr√®re's d√©c√®s
    The M√©moire be verte, and that it us befitted
    To bear our c≈ìurs in douleur, and our enti√®re Royaume
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion combattue with la,la,la,nature
    That we with wisest chagrin pense on him
    Together with remembrance of nous-m√™mes.
    Therefore our parfois s≈ìur, now our reine,
    Th' imperial jointress to this guerri√®re Etat,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With gaiet√© in funeral, and with dirge in mariage,
    In √©gale scale weighing d√©lice and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better sagesses, laquelle have librement gone
    With this affair le,long,de. For all, our remerciers.
    Now suivres, that you know, Jeune Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our vaut,
    Or penseing by our late dear fr√®re's d√©c√®s
    Our Etat to be disjoint and out of Cadre,
    Colleagued with this r√™ver of his aaaavantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrendre of celles terres
    Lost by his p√®re, with all bands of law,
    To our most vaillante fr√®re. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of r√©union.
    Thus much the affaires is: we have here writ
    To Norway, oncle of Jeune Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, rarely hears
    Of this his nephew's objetif, to suppress
    His plus,loin gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his mati√®re; and we here envoi
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this saluering to old Norway,
    Giving to you no plus,loin la,la,la,personneneneal Puissance
    To affaires with the King, more than the scope
    Of celles-ci dilated articles allow.            [Gives a papier.]
    Farewell, and let your h√¢te commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all choses, will we show our duty.
  King. We doute it rien. Heartily adieu.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You ne,peux,pas parler of raison to the Dane
    And lose your voix. What auraitst thou beg, Laertes,
    That doit not be my offre, not thy asking?
    The head is not more originaire,de to the c≈ìur,
    The hand more instrumental to the bouche,
    Than is the tr√¥ne of Denmark to thy p√®re.
    What auraitst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My  lord,
    Your laisser and favoriser to revenir to France;
    From wPar,cons√©quent bien,que pr√™tely I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My bien,quets and wishes bend encore vers France
    And bow them to your gracious laisser and pardon.
  King. Have you your p√®re's laisser? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow laisser
    By la,main,d'oeuvresome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consentementementement.
    I do beseech you give him laisser to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best la,gr√¢ces d√©penser it at thy will!
    But now, my cousineee Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [de,c√¥t√©] A peu more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the des,nuages encore hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nuited Couleur off,
    And let thine eye look like a amie on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble p√®re in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis commune. All that vies must die,
    Passing thrugueux la,la,la,nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is commune.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particuli√®re with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not seule my inky cloak, good m√®re,
    Nor Douaneary suits of solennelle noir,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd souffle,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, formes of douleur,
    'That can denote me vraiment. These En,effet seem,
    For they are actions that a man pourrait play;
    But I have that dans laquelle passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sucr√© and commendable in your la,la,la,nature, Hamlet,
    To give celles-ci mourning duties to your p√®re;
    But you must know, your p√®re lost a p√®re;
    That p√®re lost, lost his, and the survivor li√©e
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious chagrin. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a cours
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly douleur;
    It montre a will most incorrect to paradis,
    A c≈ìur unfortified, a mind impatienteee,
    An soussupportering Facile and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as commune
    As any the most vulgar chose to sens,
    Why devrait we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to c≈ìur? Fie! 'tis a faute to paradis,
    A faute encorest the dead, a faute to la,la,la,nature,
    To raison most absurd, dont commune theme
    Is d√©c√®s of p√®res, and who encore hath cried,
    From the premi√®re corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you jeter to Terre
    This unprevailing woe, and pense of us
    As of a p√®re; for let the monde take note
    You are the most immediate to our tr√¥ne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that laquelle tr√®s,cher p√®re le,baissier his son
    Do I impart vers you. For your intentionionion
    In Aller back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our le,d√©sir;
    And we beseech you, bend you to rester
    Here in the acclamation and confort of our eye,
    Our gronderest tribunalier, cousineee, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy m√®re lose her pri√®res, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I doit in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a aimante and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This douce and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my c≈ìur; in la,gr√¢ce o√πof,
    No jocund sant√© that Denmark boissons to-day
    But the g√©niale cannon to the des,nuages doit tell,
    And the King's rouse the paradis doit bruit encore,
    Reparlering Terrely tonnerre. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid la,chaise aurait melt,
    Thaw, and resolve lui-m√™me into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-srireter! O God! God!
    How se,lasser, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this monde!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded jardin
    That grows to seed; choses rank and brute in la,la,la,nature
    Possess it merely. That it devrait come to this!
    But two moiss dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellenteee a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so aimante to my m√®re
    That he pourrait not beteem the winds of paradis
    Visit her face too rugueuxly. Heaven and Terre!
    Must I rappelles,toi? Why, she aurait hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grandie
    By what it fed on; and yet, dans a mois-
    Let me not pense on't! Frailty, thy name is femme!-
    A peu mois, or ere celles shoes were old
    With laquelle she suivreed my poor p√®re's body
    Like Niobe, all larmes- why she, even she
    (O God! a la,b√™te that wants discours of raison
    Would have mourn'd lus,long) married with my oncle;
    My p√®re's fr√®re, but no more like my p√®re
    Than I to Hercules. Within a mois,
    Ere yet the salt of most undroiteeous larmes
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked la,vitesse, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it ne,peux,pas come to good.
    But break my c≈ìur, for I must hold my langue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your seigneurie!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do oublier moi,m√™me.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servanteee ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good amie- I'll changementmentment that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-
    But what, in Foi, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I aurait not hear your ennemie say so,
    Nor doit you do my ear that violence
    To make it confianceer of your own rapport
    Against le,tienself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll enseigner you to boisson deep ere you partir.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your p√®re's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, compagne student.
    I pense it was to see my m√®re's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it suivreed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish en,avant the mariage tables.
    Would I had met my tr√®s,cher foe in paradis
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My p√®re- mepenses I see my p√®re.
  Hor. O, o√π, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I doit not look upon his like encore.
  Hor. My lord, I pense I saw him yesternuit.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your p√®re.
  Ham. The King my p√®re?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a tandis,que
    With an attent ear, till I may livrer
    Upon the t√©moin of celles-ci doucemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nuits ensemble had celles-ci doucemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on leur qui,concerneer
    In the dead vast and middle of the nuit
    Been thus encompter'red. A figure like your p√®re,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears avant them and with solennelle Mars
    Goes slow and Etatly by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By leur oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they diencore'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and parler not to him. This to me
    In ful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the troisi√®me nuit kept the qui,concerneer;
    Where, as they had livrer'd, both in time,
    Form of the chose, each word made true and good,
    The apparition vient. I knew your p√®re.
    These mains are not more like.
  Ham. But o√π was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform o√π we qui,concerneer'd.
  Ham. Did you not parler to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But r√©pondre made it none. Yet once mebien,quet
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to mouvement, like as it aurait parler;
    But even then the Matin cock crew loud,
    And at the du,son it shrunk in h√¢te away
    And vanish'd from our vue.
  Ham. 'Tis very √©trange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did pense it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, En,effet, sirs. But this difficult√©s me.
    Hold you the qui,concerneer to-nuit?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he froncer,les,sourcilsingly.
  Hor. A compterenance more in chagrin than in col√®re.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constanteeely.
  Ham. I aurait I had been L√.
  Hor. It aurait have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate h√¢te pourrait tell a cent.
  Both. Longer, lus,long.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His barbe was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable argent'd.
  Ham. I will qui,concerneer to-nuit.
    Perchance 'twill walk encore.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble p√®re's la,la,la,personnenene,
    I'll parler to it, bien,que hell lui-m√™me devrait gape
    And bid me hold my paix. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this vue,
    Let it be tenable in your silence encore;
    And whatsoever else doit hap to-nuit,
    Give it an soussupportering but no langue.
    I will reassez your aime. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visiteee you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your aime, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My p√®re's esprit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doute some foul play. Would the nuit were come!
    Till then sit encore, my soul. Foul actes will rise,
    Though all the Terre o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the maison of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, s≈ìur, as the winds give aaaavantage
    And convoy is assistant, do not dormir,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doute that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favoriser,
    Hold it a mode, and a toy in du,sang;
    A violet in the jeunesse of primy la,la,la,nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sucr√©, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For la,la,la,nature crescent does not grow seule
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward un,un,un,service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide avec. Perhaps he aime you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The vertu of his will; but you must fear,
    His g√©nialeness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is mati√®re to his naissance.
    He may not, as unvalued la,la,la,personnenenes do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choix depends
    The s√©curit√© and sant√© of this enti√®re Etat,
    And L√fore must his choix be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voix and rendementing of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he aime you,
    It fits your sagesse so far to croyez it
    As he in his particuli√®re act and endroit
    May give his en,disant deed; laquelle is no plus,loin
    Than the main voix of Denmark goes avec.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sutache
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your c≈ìur, or your ch√¢te Tr√©sor open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear s≈ìur,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and dcol√®re of le,d√©sir.
    The chariest maid is prodigal assez
    If she unmask her beaut√© to the moon.
    Virtue lui-m√™me scopes not calumnious accident,vasculaire,c√©r√©brals.
    The canker galls the infants of the printemps
    Too oft avant leur buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of jeunesse
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best s√©curit√© lies in fear.
    Youth to lui-m√™me rebels, bien,que none else near.
  Oph. I doit th' effet of this good lesson keep
    As qui,concerneerman to my c≈ìur. But, good my fr√®re,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to paradis,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance bande,de,roulements
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my p√®re vient.
    A double b√©niring is a double la,gr√¢ce;
    Occasion sourires upon a secondeee laisser.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for la,honte!
    The wind sits in the devraiter of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my b√©niring with thee!
    And celles-ci few precepts in thy M√©moire
    Look thou character. Give thy bien,quets no langue,
    Nor any unproportion'd bien,quet his act.
    Be thou famili√®re, but by no veux,dire vulgar:
    Those amies thou hast, and leur adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of acier;
    But do not dull thy palm with entrertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a querelle; but √©tant in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give chaque man thine ear, but few thy voix;
    Take each man's censure, but reservir thy jugement.
    Costly thy habitudeudeude as thy bourse can buy,
    But not express'd in fantaisie; rich, not gaudy;
    For the v√™tements oft propr√©tendres the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, gronder in that.
    NSoit a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both lui-m√™me and amie,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of mariry.
    This au,dessus all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must suivre, as the nuit the day,
    Thou canst not then be faux to any man.
    Farewell. My b√©niring saison this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my laisser, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servanteees tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and rappelles,toi well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my M√©moire lock'd,
    And you le,tienself doit keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So S'il,vous,pla√Æt you, quelque,chose touchererering the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bebien,quet!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given priv√©e time to you, and you le,tienself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not soussupporter le,tienself so clairely
    As it behooves my fille and your honour.
    What is entre you? Give me up the v√©rit√©.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many soumissionners
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You parler like a verte girl,
    Unsifted in such p√©rilous circumstance.
    Do you croyez his soumissionners, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I devrait pense,
  Pol. Marry, I will enseigner you! Think le,tienself a baby
    That you have ta'en celles-ci soumissionners for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender le,tienself more ch√®rement,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll soumissionner me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable mode.
  Pol. Ay, mode you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath donn√©e compterenance to his discours, my lord,
    With presque all the holy vows of paradis.
  Pol. Ay, printempses to capture woodcocks! I do know,
    When the du,sang burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the langue vows. These blazes, fille,
    Giving more lumi√®re than heat, extinct in both
    Even in leur promettre, as it is a-fabrication,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be quelque,chose scanter of your jeune,fille pr√©sence.
    Set your supplierments at a higher rate
    Than a commandererer to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is Jeune,
    And with a grander tether may he walk
    Than may be donn√©e you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not croyez his vows; for they are cass√©ers,
    Not of that dye laquelle leur investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breachose like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I aurait not, in plaineee termes, from this time en,avant
    Have you so calomnie any moment loisir
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I doit obey, my lord.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform avant the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I pense it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is frapp√©.
  Hor. Indeed? I entendue it not. It then draws near the saison
    Wherein the esprit held his wont to walk.
                   A fleurir of trompettes, and two pi√®ces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-nuit and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upprintemps reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trompette thus bray out
    The triomphe of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a Douane?
  Ham. Ay, ma√Ætresse, is't;
    But to my mind, bien,que I am originaire,de here
    And to the mani√®re born, it is a Douane
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This lourde-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of autre nations;
    They clip us ivreards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and En,effet it takes
    From our achievements, bien,que perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particuli√®re men
    That, for some vicious mole of la,la,la,nature in them,
    As in leur naissance,- o√πin they are not coupable,
    Since la,la,la,nature ne,peux,pas choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of raison,
    Or by some habitudeudeude that too much o'erlaisserns
    The form of plausive mani√®res, that celles-ci men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being la,la,la,nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their vertus else- be they as pure as la,gr√¢ce,
    As infinie as man may sousgo-
    Shall in the g√©n√©rale censure take corruption
    From that particuli√®re faute. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance souvent dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it vient!
  Ham. Angels and ministres of la,gr√¢ce d√©fendre us!
    Be thou a esprit of sant√© or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from paradis or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intentionionions wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable forme
    That I will parler to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, p√®re, royaleee Dane. O, r√©pondre me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd desos, hearsed in d√©c√®s,
    Have burst leur cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee silencieusely inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up encore. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, encore in achev√©e acier,
    Revisiteees thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making nuit hideous, and we imb√©ciles of la,la,la,nature
    So horridly to secouer our disposition
    With bien,quets au-del√ the reaches of our √¢mes?
    Say, why is this? o√πfore? What devrait we do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did le,d√©sir
    To you seule.
  Mar. Look with what tribunaleous action
    It waves you to a more removed sol.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no veux,dire!
  Ham. It will not parler. Then will I suivre it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what devrait be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a chose immortelle as lui-m√™me?
    It waves me en,avant encore. I'll suivre it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you vers the inonder, my lord,
    Or to the ful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And L√ assume some autre, horrible form
    Which pourrait deprive your sover√®gnety of raison
    And draw you into la,d√©mence? Think of it.
    The very endroit puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into chaque cerveau
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me encore.
    Go on. I'll suivre thee.
  Mar. You doit not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your mains!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You doit not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And fait,du each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]
    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, doucemen.
    By paradis, I'll make a fant√¥me of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll suivre thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes d√©sesp√©r√©e with imagination.
  Mar. Let's suivre. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have apr√®s. To what probl√®me wail this come?
  Mar. Somechose is pourrie in the Etat of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's suivre him.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Anautre part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no plus,loin.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is presque come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must rendre up moi,m√™me.
  Ham. Alas, poor fant√¥me!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I doit unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am li√©e to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to vengeance, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy p√®re's esprit,
    Doom'd for a certaineee term to walk the nuit,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of la,la,la,nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am interdire
    To tell the secr√®tes of my prison maison,
    I pourrait a tale unfold dont lumi√®reest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy Jeune du,sang,
    Make thy two eyes, like √©toiles, start from leur spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particuli√®re hair to supporter an end
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
    But this √©ternelle blazon must not be
    To ears of la,chaise and du,sang. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear p√®re love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unla,la,la,naturelle plus.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, √©trange, and unla,la,la,naturelle.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with ailes as rapide
    As meditation or the bien,quets of love,
    May sweep to my vengeance.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller devraitst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots lui-m√™me in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis donn√©e out that, dormiring in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the enti√®re ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my d√©c√®s
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble jeunesse,
    The serpent that did sting thy p√®re's life
    Now wears his couronne.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My oncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate la,b√™te,
    With sorci√®recraft of his wit, with tra√Ætresseous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the Puissance
    So to seduce!- won to his la,honteful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous reine.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was L√,
    From me, dont love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in mariage, and to decline
    Upon a mis√©rable dont la,la,la,naturelle gifts were poor
    To celles of mine!
    But vertu, as it jamais will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness tribunal it in a forme of paradis,
    So lust, bien,que to a radiant ange link'd,
    Will sate lui-m√™me in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! mepenses I scent the Matin air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping dans my orchard,
    My Douane toujours of the apr√®snoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy oncle stole,
    With juice of mal√©dictiond hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; dont effet
    Holds such an enmity with du,sang of man
    That rapide as rapideargentr it courss thrugueux
    The la,la,la,naturelle portes and alleys of the body,
    And with a soudaine vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and enti√®resome du,sang. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd √,propos,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and lsermentsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, dormiring, by a fr√®re's hand
    Of life, of couronne, of reine, at once envoi'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my Compte
    With all my imparfaiteions on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast la,la,la,nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royaleee bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damn√©e incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy m√®re aught. Leave her to paradis,
    And to celles thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm montre the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffetual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.
  Ham. O all you host of paradis! O Terre! What else?
    And doit I couple hell? Hold, hold, my c≈ìur!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor fant√¥me, tandis,que M√©moire tient a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my M√©moire
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That jeunesse and observation copied L√,
    And thy commanderererment all seule doit live
    Within the book and volume of my cerveau,
    Unmix'd with baser mati√®re. Yes, by paradis!
    O most pernicious femme!
    O sc√©l√©rat, sc√©l√©rat, smiling, damn√©e sc√©l√©rat!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may sourire, and sourire, and be a sc√©l√©rat;
    At moins I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, oncle, L√ you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have jur√©e't.
  Hor. (dans) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, merveilleful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by paradis!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would c≈ìur of man once pense it?
    But you'll be secr√®te?
  Both. Ay, by paradis, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a sc√©l√©rat habitudeudeudeering in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant friponne.
  Hor. There Besoins no fant√¥me, my lord, come from the la,tombe
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, droite! You are in the droite!
    And so, sans,pour,autant more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we secouer mains and part;
    You, as your affaires and le,d√©sirs doit point you,
    For chaque man hath affaires and le,d√©sir,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am Pardon they offenser you, c≈ìurily;
    Yes, Foi, c≈ìurily.
  Hor. There's no infraction, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patour, but L√ is, Horatio,
    And much infraction too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honn√™te fant√¥me, that let me tell you.
    For your le,d√©sir to know what is entre us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good amies,
    As you are amies, scholars, and soldates,
    Give me one poor demandeee.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make connue what you have seen to-nuit.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but jurer't.
  Hor. In Foi,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in Foi.
  Ham. Upon my √©p√©e.
  Mar. We have jur√©e, my lord, d√©j√.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my √©p√©e, En,effet.

                 Ghost cries sous the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou L√, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this compagne in the cellarage.
    Consent to jurer.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to parler of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my √©p√©e.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our sol.
    Come hither, doucemen,
    And lay your mains encore upon my √©p√©e.
    Never to parler of this that you have entendue:
    Swear by my √©p√©e.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his √©p√©e.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' Terre so fast?
    A vauty pioner! Once more remove, good amies."
  Hor. O day and nuit, but this is wondrous √©trange!
  Ham. And L√fore as a strcol√®re give it Bienvenue.
    There are more choses in paradis and Terre, Horatio,
    Than are r√™vert of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as avant, jamais, so help you piti√©,
    How √©trange or odd soe'er I bear moi,m√™me
    (As I perchance hereapr√®s doit pense meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such fois voyant me, jamais doit,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-secouer,
    Or by pronouncing of some douteful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We pourrait, an if we aurait,'
    Or 'If we list to parler,' or 'There be, an if they pourrait,'
    Or such ambiguous donnant out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So la,gr√¢ce and piti√© at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They jurer.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed esprit! So, doucemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and amieing to you,
    God pr√™te, doit not lack. Let us go in ensemble;
    And encore your doigts on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O mal√©dictiond d√©pit
    That ever I was born to set it droite!
    Nay, come, let's go ensemble.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the maison of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this argent and celles-ci notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You doit do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visiteee him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did avoir,l'intentionionionion it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me premi√®re what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what veux,dire, and o√π they keep,
    What entreprise, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particuli√®re demandeees will touchererer it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant connaissance of him;
    As thus, 'I know his p√®re and his amies,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and L√ put on him
    What forgeries you S'il,vous,pla√Æt; ma√Ætresse, none so rank
    As may d√©shonorer him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are un,compagnons noted and most connue
    To jeunesse and libert√©.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or boissoning, fencing, jurering, querelleling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that aurait d√©shonorer him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may saison it in the charge.
    You must not put un,autre scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my sens. But soufflee his fautes so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of libert√©,
    The flash and outbreak of a fougueuse mind,
    A savageness in unrepr√©tendreed du,sang,
    Of g√©n√©rale assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore devrait you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I aurait know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I croyez it is a chercher of mandat.
    You laying celles-ci slumi√®re sullies on my son
    As 'twere a chose a peu soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your f√™te in converse, him you aurait du,son,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The jeunesse you soufflee of coupable, be assur'd
    He proches with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'amie,' or 'douceman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and compterry-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I √,propos to say?
    By the mass, I was √,propos to say quelque,chose! Where did I laisser?
  Rey. At 'proches in the consequence,' at 'amie or so,' and
    douceman.'
  Pol. At 'proches in the consequence'- Ay, ma√Ætresse!
    He proches thus: 'I know the douceman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'autre day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; L√ o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him entrer such a maison of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so en,avant.
    See you now-
    Your bait of fauxhood takes this carp of v√©rit√©;
    And thus do we of sagesse and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my ancienne lecture and Conseil,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observir his inclination in le,tienself.
  Rey. I doit, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his la,musique.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the mati√®re?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affdroiteed!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my prochet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stocrois foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his les,genoux frappeing each autre,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been ampled out of hell
    To parler of horrors- he vient avant me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But vraiment I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his autre hand thus o'er his brow,
    He des,chutes to such perusal of my face
    As he aurait draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a peu shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and proa,trouv√©
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his √©tant. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his devraiter turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way sans,pour,autant his eyes,
    For out o' des,portes he went sans,pour,autant leur help
    And to the last bended leur lumi√®re on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violenteee correctety fordoes lui-m√™me
    And leads the will to d√©sesp√©r√©e soustarois
    As oft as any la,la,la,passion sous paradis
    That does afflict our la,la,la,natures. I am Pardon.
    What, have you donn√©e him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did commandererer,
    I did repel his lettres and refus√©
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am Pardon that with better heed and jugement
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And signifiait to wrack thee; but beshrew my jalousey!
    By paradis, it is as correcte to our age
    To cast au-del√ nous-m√™mes in our opinions
    As it is commune for the Jeuneer sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be connue; laquelle, √©tant kept proche, pourrait move
    More douleur to hide than hate to prononcer love.
    Come.
                                                         Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Somechose have you entendue
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it devrait be,
    More than his p√®re's d√©c√®s, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' soussupportering of himself,
    I ne,peux,pas r√™ver of. I supplier you both
    That, √©tant of so Jeune clays apport√© up with him,
    And depuis so voisine'd to his jeunesse and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our tribunal
    Some peu time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to plaisirs, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unconnue afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies dans our rem√®de.
  Queen. Good doucemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men L√ are not vivante
    To whom he more adheres. If it will S'il,vous,pla√Æt you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us quelque,temps
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visiteeeation doit recevoir such remerciers
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sover√®gne Puissance you have of us,
    Put your  plaisirs more into commandererer
    Than to suppliery.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up nous-m√™mes, in the full bent,
    To lay our un,un,un,service librement at your feet,
    To be commandererered.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and douce Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and douce Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visiteee
    My too much changementmentmentd son.- Go, some of you,
    And apporter celles-ci doucemen o√π Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our pr√©sence and our entraine,tois
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                                    Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully revenir'd.
  King. Thou encore hast been the p√®re of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do pense- or else this cerveau of mine
    Hunts not the trail of politique so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have a,trouv√©
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, parler of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give premi√®re admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news doit be the fruit to that g√©niale le,banquet.
  King. Thyself do la,gr√¢ce to them, and apporter them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    He raconte me, my dear Gertrude, he hath a,trouv√©
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doute it is no autre but the main,
    His p√®re's d√©c√®s and our o'erhasty mariage.
  King. Well, we doit sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good amies.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our fr√®re Norway?
  Volt. Most fair revenir of saluerings and le,d√©sirs.
    Upon our premi√®re, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; laquelle to him appara√Ætre'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he vraiment a,trouv√©
    It was encorest your Highness; o√πat griev'd,
    That so his maladie, age, and impotence
    Was fauxly support√© in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; laquelle he, in br√®ve, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow avant his oncle jamais more
    To give th' assay of arms encorest your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand couronnes in annual fee
    And his commission to employ celles soldates,
    So levied as avant, encorest the Polack;
    With an suppliery, herein plus,loin shown,
                                                [Gives a papier.]
    That it pourrait S'il,vous,pla√Æt you to give silencieuse pass
    Thrugueux your dominions for this entrerprise,
    On such qui,concernes of s√©curit√© and allowance
    As L√in are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consid√©rer'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and pense upon this affaires.
    Meantime we remercier you for your well-took la,main,d'oeuvre.
    Go to your rest; at nuit we'll le,banquet ensemble.
    Most Bienvenue home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This affaires is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majest√© devrait be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, nuit is nuit, and time is time.
    Were rien but to d√©chets nuit, day, and time.
    Therefore, depuis brevity is the soul of wit,
    And fastidieuseness the membres and vers,l'ext√©rieur fleurires,
    I will be br√®ve. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true la,d√©mence,
    What is't but to be rien else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More mati√®re, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I jurer I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A insens√©e figure!
    But adieu it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us subvention him then. And now resters
    That we find out the cause of this effet-
    Or plut√¥t say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effet defective vient by cause.
    Thus it resters, and the resterder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a fille (have tandis,que she is mine),
    Who in her duty and ob√©issance, mark,
    Hath donn√©e me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             [Reads] the lettre.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you doit hear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellenteee white bosom, celles-ci, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay quelque,temps. I will be Foiful.     [Reads.]

          'Doubt thou the √©toiles are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt v√©rit√© to be a liar;
            But jamais doute I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at celles-ci nombres; I have not art to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, croyez
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
                                                          HAMLET.'

    This, in ob√©issance, hath my fille shown me;
    And more au,dessus, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by veux,dire, and endroit,
    All donn√©e to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you pense of me?
  King. As of a man Foiful and honourable.
  Pol. I aurait fain prouver so. But what pourrait you pense,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my fille told me), what pourrait you,
    Or my dear Majesty your reine here, pense,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or donn√©e my c≈ìur a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle vue?
    What pourrait you pense? No, I went ronde to work
    And my Jeune ma√Ætresse thus I did beparler:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she devrait lock se from his resort,
    Admit no messag√®res, recevoir no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my Conseil,
    And he, repulsed, a tribunale tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    TPar,cons√©quent to a qui,concerneer, tPar,cons√©quent into a weakness,
    TPar,cons√©quent to a lumi√®reness, and, by this declension,
    Into the la,d√©mence o√πin now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you pense 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath L√ been such a time- I aurait fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd autrewise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and devraiter] Take this from this, if this
      be autrewise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where v√©rit√© is hid, bien,que it were hid En,effet
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it plus,loin?
  Pol. You know parfoiss he walks four heures ensemble
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does En,effet.
  Pol. At such a time I'll ample my fille to him.
    Be you and I derri√®re an arras then.
    Mark the encompterer. If he love her not,
    And he not from his raison fall'n L√on
    Let me be no assistant for a Etat,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look o√π sadly the poor mis√©rable vient reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him pr√©sentely. O, give me laisser.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-piti√©.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I aurait you were so honn√™te a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honn√™te, as this monde goes, is to be one man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun race maggots in a dead dog, √©tant a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a fille?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a b√©niring, but not
    as your fille may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [de,c√¥t√©] How say you by that? Still harping on my fille. Yet
    he knew me not at premi√®re. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far
    gone, far gone! And vraiment in my jeunesse I suff'red much extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll parler to him encore.- What do you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the mati√®re, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the mati√®re that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical coquine says here that old men
    have grey barbes; that leur visages are wrinkled; leur eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, ensemble with most weak hams. All laquelle,
    sir, bien,que I most Puissancefully and potently croyez, yet I hold it
    not honn√™tey to have it thus set down; for you le,tienself, sir,
    devrait be old as I am if, like a crab, you pourrait go backward.
  Pol. [de,c√¥t√©] Though this be la,d√©mence, yet L√ is a method in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my la,tombe?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant parfoiss
    his replies are! a bonheur that souvent la,d√©mence hits on, laquelle
    raison and sanity pourrait not so prosperously be livrered of. I
    will laisser him and soudainely contrive the veux,dire of r√©union entre
    him and my fille.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
    my laisser of you.
  Ham. You ne,peux,pas, sir, take from me n'importe,quoi that I will more
    pr√™tely part avec- sauf my life, sauf my life, sauf my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These fastidieuse old imb√©ciles!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].
  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellenteee good amies! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent enfantren of the Terre.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-heureuse.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. NSoit, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live √,propos her waist, or in the middle of her
    favorisers?
  Guil. Faith, her priv√©es we.
  Ham. In the secr√®te les,pi√®ces of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strompette. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the monde's grandie honn√™te.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particuli√®re. What have you, my good amies,
    m√©riterd at the mains of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the monde one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in laquelle L√ are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark √©tant one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We pense not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for L√ is rien Soit good
    or bad but penseing fait,du it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition fait,du it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I pourrait be li√©eed in a nutshell and compter moi,m√™me a
    king of infinie space, were it not that I have bad r√™vers.
  Guil. Which r√™vers En,effet are ambition; for the very substance of
    the ambitious is merely the ombre of a r√™ver.
  Ham. A r√™ver lui-m√™me is but a ombre.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and lumi√®re a qualit√© that
    it is but a ombre's ombre.
  Ham. Then are our gueuxs corps, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
    heroes the gueuxs' ombres. Shall we to th' tribunal? for, by my
    fay, I ne,peux,pas raison.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such mati√®re! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servanteees; for, to parler to you like an honn√™te man, I am most
    fully ass≈ìured. But in the battue way of amieship, what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visiteee you, my lord; no autre occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in remerciers; but I remercier you;
    and sure, dear amies, my remerciers are too dear a halfpenny. Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visiteeeation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, parler.
  Guil. What devrait we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, n'importe,quoi- but to th' objetif. You were sent for; and
    L√ is a kind of confession in your looks, laquelle your modesteeeies
    have not craft assez to Couleur. I know the good King and Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must enseigner me. But let me conjure you by the droites
    of our compagneship, by the consonancy of our jeunesse, by the
    obligation of our ever-preservird love, and by what more dear a
    better proposer pourrait charge you avec, be even and direct with
    me, qu'il,s'agisse you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [de,c√¥t√© to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [de,c√¥t√©] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So doit my anticipation prevent your
    d√©couvriry, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but o√πfore I know not- lost all my
    gaiet√©, forgone all Douane of exercises; and En,effet, it goes so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly Cadre, the Terre,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellenteee canopy, the
    air, look you, this courageuse o'erpendaison firmament, this majestical
    roof fretted with d'or fire- why, it appara√Ætreeth no autre chose
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
    pi√®ce of work is a man! how noble in raison! how infinie in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an ange! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beaut√© of the monde, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man d√©lices not me- no, nor femme
    nSoit, bien,que by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, L√ was no such des,trucs in my bien,quets.
  Ham. Why did you rire then, when I said 'Man d√©lices not me'?
  Ros. To pense, my lord, if you d√©lice not in man, what lenten
    entrertainment the players doit recevoir from you. We coted them
    on the way, and hither are they venir to offre you un,un,un,service.
  Ham. He that plays the king doit be Bienvenue- his Majesty doit
    have tribute of me; the adventurous Chevalier doit use his foil and
    target; the lover doit not sigh gratis; the humorous man doit
    end his part in paix; the pitre doit make celles rire dont
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady doit say her mind
    librement, or the blank verse doit halt fort. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even celles you were wont to take such d√©lice in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    r√©putation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I pense leur inhibition vient by the veux,dire of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
    city? Are they so suivre'd?
  Ros. No En,effet are they not.
  Ham. How vient it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, leur endeavour garde in the wonted pace; but L√ is,
    sir, an eyrie of enfantren, peu eyases, that cry out on the top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
    the mode, and so berattle the commune stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are peur of goosequills and
    dare rare come thither.
  Ham. What, are they enfantren? Who maintenirs 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the qualit√© no lus,long than they can
    sing? Will they not say apr√®swards, if they devrait grow
    se to commune players (as it is most like, if leur veux,dire
    are no better), leur √©crirers do them faux to make them expr√©tendre
    encorest leur own Succ√®sion.
  Ros. Faith, L√ has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
    tient it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
    tandis,que, no argent bid for argument sauf,si the poet and the player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, L√ has been much jetering √,propos of cerveaus.
  Ham. Do the boys porter it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very √©trange; for my oncle is King of Denmark, and
    celles that aurait make mows at him tandis,que my p√®re lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a cent ducats api√®ce for his image in
    peu. 'Sdu,sang, L√ is quelque,chose in this more than la,la,la,naturelle, if
    philosophy pourrait find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are Bienvenue to Elsinore. Your mains, come! Th'
    appurtenance of Bienvenue is mode and ceremony. Let me comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (laquelle I
    tell you must show fairly vers,l'ext√©rieurs) devrait more appara√Ætre like
    entrertainment than le,tiens. You are Bienvenue. But my oncle-p√®re
    and aunt-m√®re are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
    know a hawk from a mainsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, doucemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That g√©niale baby you see L√ is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the secondeee time come to them; for they say an old
    man is deux,fois a enfant.
  Ham. I will prophesy he vient to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
   You say droite, sir; a Monday Matin; twas so En,effet.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the monde, Soit for tragedy, comedy,
    hir√©cit, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; sc√®ne
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca ne,peux,pas be too lourde, nor
    Plautus too lumi√®re. For the law of writ and the libert√©, celles-ci are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, juge of Israel, what a Tr√©sor hadst thou!
  Pol. What Tr√©sor had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair fille, and no more,
           The laquelle he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [de,c√¥t√©] Still on my fille.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' droite, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a fille that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that suivres not.
  Pol. What suivres then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The premi√®re row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
    o√π my abridgment vient.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are Bienvenue, masters; Bienvenue, all.- I am glad to see thee
    well.- Welcome, good amies.- O, my old amie? Why, thy face is
    valanc'd depuis I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' barbe me in
    Denmark?- What, my Jeune lady and ma√Ætresse? By'r Lady, your
    Madame is nearer to paradis than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voix, like a pi√®ce of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd dans the ring.- Masters, you are
    all Bienvenue. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    n'importe,quoi we see. We'll have a discours tout,droit. Come, give us a
    go√ªt of your qualit√©. Come, a la,la,la,passionate discours.
  1. Play. What discours, my good lord?
  Ham. I entendue thee parler me a discours once, but it was jamais acted;
    or if it was, not au,dessus once; for the play, I rappelles,toi, pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the g√©n√©rale; but it was (as I
    receiv'd it, and autres, dont jugements in such mati√®res cried in
    the top of mine) an excellenteee play, well digested in the sc√®nes,
    set down with as much modesteeey as ruse. I rappelles,toi one said
    L√ were no sallets in the lines to make the mati√®re savoury,
    nor no mati√®re in the phrase that pourrait indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honn√™te method, as enti√®resome as
    sucr√©, and by very much more mainsome than fine. One discours in't
    I gronderly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and L√√,propos of it
    esp√©cialely o√π he parlers of Priam's srireter. If it live in
    your M√©moire, commencer at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian la,b√™te-'

    'Tis not so; it commencers with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he dont sable arms,
         Black as his objetif, did the nuit resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous jument,
         Hath now this  and noir complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly tour'd
         With du,sang of p√®res, m√®res, filles, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching rues,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damn√©e lumi√®re
         To leur lord's plus. Roasted in col√®re and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carboncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proc√©der you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well parlaitn, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he trouve him,
      Striking too tribunale at Greeks. His antique √©p√©e,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies o√π it des,chutes,
      Repugnant to commandererer. Un√©gale rencontre'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage la,gr√®ves wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell √©p√©e
      Th' unnerved p√®re des,chutes. Then sensless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his √©p√©e,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a peinte tyran, Pyrrhus se,tenait,
      And, like a neutral to his will and mati√®re,
      Did rien.
      But, as we souvent see, encorest some temp√™te,
      A silence in the paradiss, the rack supporter encore,
      The bold winds discoursless, and the orb au,dessous,de
      As hush as d√©c√®s- anon the ful tonnerre
      Doth rend the region; so, apr√®s Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And jamais did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armure, forg'd for preuve eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding √©p√©e
      Now des,chutes on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strompette Fortune! All you gods,
      In g√©n√©rale synod take away her Puissance;
      Break all the parlaits and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the ronde nave down the hill of paradis,
      As low as to the d√©mones!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It doit to the barber's, with your barbe.- Prithee say on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he dormirs. Say on; come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled reine-'

  Ham. 'The mobled reine'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled reine' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem se,tenait, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with langue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's Etat aurait traison have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods se did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his √©p√©e her mari's membres,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless choses mortelle move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the br√ªlante eyes of paradis
      And la,la,la,passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his Couleur, and has larmes in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee parler out the rest of this soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and br√®ve
    chronicles of the time. After your d√©c√®s you were better have a
    bad epitaph than leur ill rapport tandis,que you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them selon to leur d√©serte.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use chaque man apr√®s his
    d√©serte, and who devrait scape whipping? Use them apr√®s your own
    honour and dignity. The less they m√©riter, the more m√©rite is in
    your prime. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, amies. We'll hear a play to-demain.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [sauf the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old amie? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-demain nuit. You pourrait, for a need, √©tude a
    discours of some dozen or sixteen lines laquelle I aurait set down and
    insert in't, pourrait you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                            [Exit First Player.]
    My good amies, I'll laisser you till nuit. You are Bienvenue to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am seule.
    O what a coquine and peasant esclave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a r√™ver of la,la,la,passion,
    Could Obliger his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A cass√©en voix, and his enti√®re function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for rien!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he devrait weep for her? What aurait he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for la,la,la,passion
    That I have? He aurait noyer the stage with larmes
    And claisser the g√©n√©rale ear with horrid discours;
    Make mad the coupable and appal the free,
    Cona,trouv√© the ignoranteee, and amaze En,effet
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled coquine, peak
    Like John-a-r√™vers, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say rien! No, not for a king,
    Upon dont correctety and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a l√¢che?
    Who calls me sc√©l√©rat? breaks my pate atraverser?
    Plucks off my barbe and coups it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' gorge
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Sb√©nirures, I devrait take it! for it ne,peux,pas be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression am√®re, or ere this
    I devrait have fatted all the region kites
    With this esclave's offal. Bloody bawdy sc√©l√©rat!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless sc√©l√©rat!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most courageuse,
    That I, the son of a dear p√®re plus'd,
    Prompted to my vengeance by paradis and hell,
    Must (like a putain) unpack my c≈ìur with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my cerveau! Hum, I have entendue
    That coupable cr√©atures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very ruse of the sc√®ne
    Been frapp√© so to the soul that pr√©sentely
    They have propr√©tendre'd leur malefactions;
    For plus, bien,que it have no langue, will parler
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have celles-ci Players
    Play quelque,chose like the plus of my p√®re
    Before mine oncle. I'll observir his looks;
    I'll tent him to the rapide. If he but blench,
    I know my cours. The esprit that I have seen
    May be a diable; and the diable hath Puissance
    T' assume a pleasing forme; yea, and peut-√™tre
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such esprits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have sols
    More relative than this. The play's the chose
    Wherein I'll capture the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of silencieuse
    With turbulent and dcol√®reous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no veux,dire parler.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be du,soned,
    But with a crafty la,d√©mence garde aloof
    When we aurait apporter him on to some confession
    Of his true Etat.
  Queen. Did he recevoir you well?
  Ros. Most like a douceman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demandeees
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certaineee players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of celles-ci we told him,
    And L√ did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here √,propos the tribunal,
    And, as I pense, they have d√©j√ ordre
    This nuit to play avant him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to supplier your Majesties
    To hear and see the mati√®re.
  King. With all my c≈ìur, and it doth much contenu me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good doucemen, give him a plus,loin edge
    And drive his objetif on to celles-ci d√©lices.
  Ros. We doit, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, laisser us too;
    For we have prochely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her p√®re and moi,m√™me (l√©gitime espials)
    Will so bestow nous-m√™mes that, voyant unseen,
    We may of leur encompterer frankly juge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he souffrirs for.
  Queen. I doit obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the heureuse cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So doit I hope your vertus
    Will apporter him to his wonted way encore,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so S'il,vous,pla√Æt you,
    We will bestow nous-m√™mes.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may Couleur
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to faire,desre,proches in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [de,c√¥t√©] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that discours doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's joue, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the chose that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most peinte word.
    O lourde burthen!
  Pol. I hear him venir. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to souffrir
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms encorest a sea of difficult√©s,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to dormir-
    No more; and by a dormir to say we end
    The c≈ìurache, and the thousand la,la,la,naturelle shocks
    That la,chaise is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to dormir.
    To dormir- perchance to r√™ver: ay, L√'s the rub!
    For in that dormir of d√©c√®s what r√™vers may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortelle coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the le,le,le,respect
    That fait,du calamity of so long life.
    For who aurait bear the whips and m√©priss of time,
    Th' oppressor's faux, the fi√®re man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of Bureau, and the spurns
    That patienteee m√©rite of th' indigne takes,
    When he himself pourrait his silencieuseus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who aurait celles-ci fardels bear,
    To grunt and transpiration sous a se,lasser life,
    But that the  of quelque,chose apr√®s d√©c√®s-
    The und√©couvrir'd compterry, from dont bourn
    No traveller revenirs- puzzles the will,
    And fait,du us plut√¥t bear celles ills we have
    Than fly to autres that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make l√¢ches of us all,
    And thus the originaire,de hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of bien,quet,
    And entrerprises of g√©niale pith and moment
    With this qui,concerne leur currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly remercier you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of le,tiens
    That I have longed long to re-livrer.
    I pray you, now recevoir them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I jamais gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know droite well you did,
    And with them words of so sucr√© souffle compos'd
    As made the choses more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take celles-ci encore; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prouver unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honn√™te?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What veux,dire your seigneurie?
  Ham. That if you be honn√™te and fair, your honn√™tey devrait admit no
    discours to your beaut√©.
  Oph. Could beaut√©, my lord, have better commerce than with honn√™tey?
  Ham. Ay, vraiment; for the Puissance of beaut√© will plus,t√¥t transform
    honn√™tey from what it is to a bawd than the Obliger of honn√™tey can
    translate beaut√© into his likeness. This was parfois a paradox,
    but now the time gives it preuve. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me croyez so.
  Ham. You devrait not have believ'd me; for vertu ne,peux,pas so
    inoculate our old stock but we doit relish of it. I loved you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why auraitst thou be a raceer of
    sinners? I am moi,m√™me indifferent honn√™te, but yet I pourrait accuserrr
    me of such choses that it were better my m√®re had not support√© me.
    I am very fi√®re, vengeanceful, ambitious; with more infractions at my
    beck than I have bien,quets to put them in, imagination to give
    them forme, or time to act them in. What devrait such compagnes as I
    do, crawling entre Terre and paradis? We are arrant friponnes all;
    croyez none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    p√®re?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the des,portes be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    noo√π but in's own maison. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sucr√© paradiss!
  Ham. If thou dost ma√Ætresse, I'll give thee this peste for thy dowry:
    be thou as ch√¢te as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, adieu. Or if thou wilt
    Besoins ma√Ætresse, ma√Ætresse a fool; for wise men know well assez what
    monstres you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and rapidely too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O paradisly Puissances, reboutique him!
  Ham. I have entendue of your paintings too, well assez. God hath
    donn√©e you one face, and you make ynous-m√™mes un,autre. You jig, you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's cr√©atures and make your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
    me mad. I say, we will have no moe mariages. Those that are
    married d√©j√- all but one- doit live; the rest doit keep as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erjetern!
    The tribunalier's, scholar's, soldate's, eye, langue, √©p√©e,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair Etat,
    The glass of mode and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observirrs- assez, assez down!
    And I, of Dames most deject and mis√©rableed,
    That suck'd the honey of his la,musique vows,
    Now see that noble and most sover√®gne raison,
    Like sucr√© bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unrencontre'd form and feature of blown jeunesse
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, bien,que it lack'd form a peu,
    Was not like la,d√©mence. There's quelque,chose in his soul
    O'er laquelle his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doute the hatch and the disproche
    Will be some dcol√®re; laquelle for to prevent,
    I have in rapide determination
    Thus set it down: he doit with la,vitesse to England
    For the demandeee of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and compterries different,
    With variable objets, doit expel
    This quelque,chose-settled mati√®re in his c≈ìur,
    Whereon his cerveaus encore beating puts him thus
    From mode of himself. What pense you on't?
  Pol. It doit do well. But yet do I croyez
    The origin and commencement of his douleur
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We entendue it all.- My lord, do as you S'il,vous,pla√Æt;
    But if you hold it fit, apr√®s the play
    Let his reine m√®re all seule supplier him
    To show his douleur. Let her be ronde with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so S'il,vous,pla√Æt you, in the ear
    Of all leur conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him o√π
    Your sagesse best doit pense.
  King. It doit be so.
    Madness in g√©niale ones must not unqui,concerneer'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the discours, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the langue. But if you bouche it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier parlait my lines. Nor do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, temp√™te, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your la,la,la,passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offensers me to the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated compagne tear a la,la,la,passion to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the sollings, who
    (for the most part) are capable of rien but inexplicable dumb
    montre and bruit. I aurait have such a compagne whipp'd for o'erFaire
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you √©viter it.
  Player. I mandat your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame nSoit; but let your own discretion be your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
    this sp√©ciale observance, that you o'erstep not the modesteeey of
    la,la,la,nature: for n'importe,quoi so overdone is from the objetif of playing,
    dont end, both at the premi√®re and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to la,la,la,nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
    m√©pris her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, bien,que
    it make the unskilful rire, ne,peux,pas but make the judicious
    pleurer; the censure of the laquelle one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a enti√®re theatre of autres. O, L√ be players that I
    have seen play, and entendue autres louange, and that highly (not to
    parler it profanely), that, nSoit ayant the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
    strutted and bellowed that I have bien,quet some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
  Ham. O, reform it alensemble! And let celles that play your pitres
    parler no more than is set down for them. For L√ be of them
    that will se rire, to set on some quantity of d√©nud√©e
    spectators to rire too, bien,que in the mean time some necessary
    question of the play be then to be consid√©rered. That's villanous
    and montre a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
    make you pr√™te.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this pi√®ce of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that pr√©sentely.
  Ham. Bid the players make h√¢te, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to h√¢ten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sucr√© lord, at your un,un,un,service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd avec.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not pense I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good esprits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why devrait the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied langue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may suivre fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was ma√Ætresse of her choix
    And pourrait of men distinguish, her election
    Hath scald thee for se. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that souffrirs rien;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with √©gale remerciers; and heureuse are celles
    Whose du,sang and jugement are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's doigt
    To du,son what stop she S'il,vous,pla√Æt. Give me that man
    That is not la,la,la,passion's esclave, and I will wear him
    In my c≈ìur's core, ay, in my c≈ìur of c≈ìur,
    As I do thee. Somechose too much of this I
    There is a play to-nuit avant the King.
    One sc√®ne of it vient near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my p√®re's d√©c√®s.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observir my oncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not lui-m√™me unkennel in one discours,
    It is a damn√©e fant√¥me that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And apr√®s we will both our jugements join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he voler aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a fleurir. [Enter Trumpets and Kettletambours. Danish
    Mars. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and autre Lords ass≈ìurant, with the Guard
                       portering torches.

  Ham. They are venir to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a endroit.
  King. How fares our cousineee Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' Foi; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
    promettre-cramm'd. You ne,peux,pas feed capons so.
  King. I have rien with this r√©pondre, Hamlet. These words are not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was Compteed a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf L√. Be
    the players pr√™te.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your la,la,la,patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good m√®re. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, doit I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]
  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you pense I signifiait compterry mati√®res?
  Oph. I pense rien, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair bien,quet to lie entre servanteeees' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nochose.
  Oph. You are joyeux, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What devrait a man do but be joyeux?
    For look you how acclamationfully my m√®re looks, and my p√®re died
    dans 's two heures.
  Oph. Nay 'tis deux,fois two moiss, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the diable wear noir, for I'll have a
    suit of sables. O paradiss! die two moiss ago, and not forgotten
    yet? Then L√'s hope a g√©niale man's M√©moire may outlive his life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build √©glisees then; or else
    doit he souffrir not penseing on, with the hobby-jument, dont
    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-jument is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show entrers.

    Enter a King and a Queen very aimantely; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She s'agenouillers, and fait,du show of manifestationation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of fleurs. She, voyant
    him endormie, laissers him. Anon vient in a compagne, takes off his
    couronne, kisses it, pours poison in the dormirer's ears, and
    laissers him. The Queen revenirs, trouve the King dead, and fait,du
    la,la,la,passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes,
    vient in encore, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unpr√™te quelque,temps, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                                         Exeunt.

  Oph. What veux,dire this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it veux,dire misgronder.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We doit know by this compagne. The players ne,peux,pas keep Conseil;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show signifiait?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
    show, he'll not la,honte to tell you what it veux,dire.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patienteeely.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis br√®ve, my lord.
  Ham. As femme's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty fois hath Phoebus' cart gone ronde
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed sol,
      And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
      About the monde have fois twelve thirties been,
      Since love our c≈ìurs, and Hymen did our mains,
      Unite comutual in most sacr√©e bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us encore compter o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from acclamation and from your ancienne Etat.
      That I disconfiance you. Yet, bien,que I disconfiance,
      Disconfort you, my lord, it rien must;
      For women's fear and love tient quantity,
      In nSoit aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, preuve hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is g√©niale, the peust doutes are fear;
      Where peu peurs grow g√©niale, g√©niale love grows L√.
    King. Faith, I must laisser thee, love, and tribunalely too;
      My operant Puissances leur functions laisser to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair monde derri√®re,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For mari shalt thou-
    Queen. O, cona,trouv√© the rest!
      Such love must Besoins be traison in my Sein.
      When secondeee mari let me be accurst!
      None wed the secondeee but who killed the premi√®re.

  Ham. [de,c√¥t√©] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that secondeee mariage move
      Are base le,le,le,respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A secondeee time I kill my mari dead
      When secondeee mari kisses me in bed.
    King. I do croyez you pense what now you parler;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the esclave to M√©moire,
      Of violenteee naissance, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fill unsecouern when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we oublier
      To pay nous-m√™mes what to nous-m√™mes is debt.
      What to nous-m√™mes in la,la,la,passion we propose,
      The la,la,la,passion ending, doth the objetif lose.
      The violence of Soit douleur or joy
      Their own enactures with se destroy.
      Where joy most revels, douleur doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy pleurers, on mince accident.
      This monde is not for aye, nor 'tis not √©trange
      That even our aime devrait with our fortunes changementmentment;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prouver,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The g√©niale man down, you mark his favoriserite mouches,
      The poor advanc'd fait,du amies of ennemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not Besoins doit jamais lack a amie,
      And who in want a creuse amie doth try,
      Directly saisons him his ennemie.
      But, ordrely to end o√π I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contraire run
      That our dispositifs encore are overjetern;
      Our bien,quets are ours, leur ends none of our own.
      So pense thou wilt no secondeee mari wed;
      But die thy bien,quets when thy premi√®re lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor Terre to me give food, nor paradis lumi√®re,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and nuit,
      To desperation turn my confiance and hope,
      An anchor's acclamation in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I aurait have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and Par,cons√©quent pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a veuve, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she devrait break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply jur√©e. Sweet, laisser me here quelque,temps.
      My esprits grow dull, and fain I aurait beguile
      The fastidieuse day with dormir.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy cerveau,
                                                    [He] dormirs.
      And jamais come mischance entre us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth manifestation too much, mepenses.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you entendue the argument? Is L√ no infraction in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no infraction i' th'
    monde.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a plus done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;
    his wife, Baptista. You doit see anon. 'Tis a knavish pi√®ce of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    √¢mes, it toucherereres us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I pourrait interpret entre you and your love, if I pourrait see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It aurait cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and pire.
  Ham. So you must take your maris.- Begin, pluser. Pox, laisser
    thy damnable visages, and commencer! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for vengeance.

    Luc. Thoughts noir, mains apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate saison, else no cr√©ature voyant;
      Thou mixture rank, of minuit mauvaises,herbes collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy la,la,la,naturelle magic and dire correctety
      On enti√®resome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' jardin for's biens. His name's Gonzago.
    The r√©cit is extant, and √©crite in very choix Italian. You
    doit see anon how the pluser gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, fdroiteed with faux fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some lumi√®re! Away!
  All. Lights, lumi√®res, lumi√®res!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the frapp√©en deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must qui,concerneer, tandis,que some must dormir:
          Thus runs the monde away.
    Would not this, sir, and a for√™t of feathers- if the rest of my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my raz'd
    shoes, get me a compagneship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A enti√®re one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This domaine dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now r√®gnes here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You pourrait have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the fant√¥me's word for a thousand
    livre! Didst apercevoir?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some la,musique! Come, the recordres!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, √™tre,comme he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some la,musique!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a enti√®re hir√©cit.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With boisson, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; plut√¥t with choler.
  Ham. Your sagesse devrait show lui-m√™me more richer to signify this to
    the docteur; for me to put him to his purgation aurait peut-√™tre
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discours into some Cadre, and start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your m√®re, in most g√©niale affliction of esprit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are Bienvenue.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this tribunalesy is not of the droite race.
    If it doit S'il,vous,pla√Æt you to make me a enti√®resome r√©pondre, I will do
    your m√®re's commanderererment; if not, your pardon and my revenir
    doit be the end of my affaires.
  Ham. Sir, I ne,peux,pas.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a enti√®resome r√©pondre; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
    r√©pondre is I can make, you doit commandererer; or plut√¥t, as you say,
    my m√®re. Therefore no more, but to the mati√®re! My m√®re, you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath frapp√© her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O merveilleful son, that can so stonish a m√®re! But is L√ no
    sequel at the talons of this m√®re's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She le,d√©sirs to parler with you in her prochet ere you go to bed.
  Ham. We doit obey, were she ten fois our m√®re. Have you any
    plus,loin trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do encore, by celles-ci pickers and volerers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do s√ªrement
    bar the door upon your own libert√©, if you deny your douleurs to
    your amie.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voix of the King himself
    for your Succ√®sion in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'tandis,que the grass grows'- the prouverrb is quelque,chose
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recordres.

    O, the recordres! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
    you go √,propos to recover the wind of me, as if you aurait drive me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmani√®rely.
  Ham. I do not well soussupporter that. Will you play upon this pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I ne,peux,pas.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I ne,peux,pas.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touchererer of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern celles-ci ventages with your
    doigts and thumbs, give it souffle with your bouche, and it will
    discours most eloquent la,musique. Look you, celles-ci are the stops.
  Guil. But celles-ci ne,peux,pas I commandererer to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the comp√©tence.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how indigne a chose you make of me! You
    aurait play upon me; you aurait seem to know my stops; you aurait
    cueillir out the c≈ìur of my mystery; you aurait du,son me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and L√ is much la,musique,
    excellenteee voix, in this peu organ, yet ne,peux,pas you make it
    parler. 'Sdu,sang, do you pense I am easier to be play'd on than a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, bien,que you can fret me,
    you ne,peux,pas play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God b√©nir you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen aurait parler with you, and pr√©sentely.
  Ham. Do you see l√,-bas cloud that's presque in forme of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel En,effet.
  Ham. Mepenses it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my m√®re by-and-by.- They fool me to the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, amies.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    'Tis now the very sorci√®reing time of nuit,
    When √©gliseyards yawn, and hell lui-m√™me soufflees out
    Contagion to this monde. Now pourrait I boisson hot du,sang
    And do such am√®re affaires as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my m√®re!
    O c≈ìur, lose not thy la,la,la,nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero entrer this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruellelele, not unla,la,la,naturelle;
    I will parler dagues to her, but use none.
    My langue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals jamais, my soul, consentementementement!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor supporters it safe with us
    To let his la,d√©mence range. Therefore pr√©parer you;
    I your commission will en,avantwith envoi,
    And he to England doit le,long,de with you.
    The termes of our biens may not supporter
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will nous-m√™mes provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep celles many many corps safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The C√©libataire and peculiar life is li√©e
    With all the Obliger and armure of the mind
    To keep lui-m√™me from noyance; but much more
    That esprit upon dont weal depends and rests
    The vies of many. The cesse of majest√©
    Dies not seule, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To dont huge parlaits ten thousand lesser choses
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; laquelle when it des,chutes,
    Each petite annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never seule
    Did the king sigh, but with a g√©n√©rale groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', la,vitessey voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will h√¢te us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's Aller to his m√®re's prochet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey moi,m√™me
    To hear the process. I'll mandat she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a m√®re,
    Since la,la,la,nature fait,du them partial, devrait o'erhear
    The discours, of aaavantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polonius].
    O, my infraction is rank, it odeurs to paradis;
    It hath the primal eldest mal√©diction upon't,
    A fr√®re's plus! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as tranchante as will.
    My forteer guilt defeats my forte intentionionion,
    And, like a man to double affaires li√©e,
    I supporter in pause o√π I doit premi√®re commencer,
    And both neglect. What if this mal√©dictiond hand
    Were thicker than lui-m√™me with fr√®re's du,sang,
    Is L√ not rain assez in the sucr√© paradiss
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto servirs piti√©
    But to confront the visage of infraction?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold Obliger,
    To be for√™talled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd √©tant down? Then I'll look up;
    My faute is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can servir my turn? 'Forgive me my foul plus'?
    That ne,peux,pas be; depuis I am encore possess'd
    Of celles effets for laquelle I did the plus-
    My couronne, mine own ambition, and my reine.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' infraction?
    In the corrupted currents of this monde
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by Justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prix lui-m√™me
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so au,dessus.
    There is no shuffling; L√ the action lies
    In his true la,la,la,nature, and we nous-m√™mes compell'd,
    Even to the les,dents and forehead of our fautes,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what se,se,se,repentiririrance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one ne,peux,pas se,se,se,repentiririr?
    O mis√©rableed Etat! O bosom noir as d√©c√®s!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, anges! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn les,genoux; and c≈ìur with strings of acier,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He s'agenouillers.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now pourrait I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to paradis,
    And so am I reveng'd. That aurait be scann'd.
    A sc√©l√©rat kills my p√®re; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same sc√©l√©rat send
    To paradis.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not vengeance!
    He took my p√®re brutely, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit supporters, who sait save paradis?
    But in our circumstance and cours of bien,quet,
    'Tis lourde with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and saisoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, √©p√©e, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is ivre endormie; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous plaisir of his bed;
    At gaming, jurering, or √,propos some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his talons may kick at paradis,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and noir
    As hell, o√πto it goes. My m√®re stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my bien,quets rester au,dessous,de.
    Words sans,pour,autant bien,quets jamais to paradis go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's prochet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come tout,droit. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and se,tenait entre
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be ronde with him.
  Ham. (dans) Mautre, m√®re, m√®re!
  Queen. I'll mandat you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him venir.
                              [Polonius hides derri√®re the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, m√®re, what's the mati√®re?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy p√®re much offensered.
  Ham. Mautre, you have my p√®re much offensered.
  Queen. Come, come, you r√©pondre with an idle langue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked langue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the mati√®re now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your mari's fr√®re's wife,
    And (aurait it were not so!) you are my m√®re.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set celles to you that can parler.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You doit not budge I
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not plus me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [derri√®re] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass thrugueux the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [derri√®re] O, I am tu√©!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and du,sangy deed is this!
  Ham. A du,sangy deed- presque as bad, good m√®re,
    As kill a king, and ma√Ætresse with his fr√®re.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou mis√©rableed, rash, intruding fool, adieu!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some dcol√®re.
    Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your c≈ìur; for so I doit
    If it be made of penetrable des,trucs;
    If damn√©e Douane have not braz'd it so
    That it is preuve and bulwark encorest sens.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy langue
    In bruit so rude encorest me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the la,gr√¢ce and rougir of modesteeey;
    Calls vertu hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister L√; fait,du mariage vows
    As faux as dicers' serments. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction cueillirs
    The very soul, and sucr√© religion fait,du
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and comlivre mass,
    With tristful visage, as encorest the doom,
    Is bien,quet-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ay me, what act,
    That roars so loud and tonnerres in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's image, and on this,
    The comptererfeit pr√©sentement of two fr√®res.
    See what a la,gr√¢ce was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and commandererer;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lumi√®reed on a paradis-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form En,effet
    Where chaque god did seem to set his seal
    To give the monde assurance of a man.
    This was your mari. Look you now what suivres.
    Here is your mari, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his enti√®resome fr√®re. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain laisser to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You ne,peux,pas call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the du,sang is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the jugement; and what jugement
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else pourrait you not have mouvement; but sure that sens
    Is apoplex'd; for la,d√©mence aurait not err,
    Nor sens to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choix
    To servir in such a difference. What diable was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-aveugle?
    Eyes sans,pour,autant feeling, feeling sans,pour,autant vue,
    Ears sans,pour,autant mains or eyes, odeuring sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sens
    Could not so mope.
    O la,honte! o√π is thy rougir? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's desos,
    To flaming jeunesse let vertu be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Propr√©tendre no la,honte
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost lui-m√™me as actively doth burn,
    And raison panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, parler no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And L√ I see such noir and grained spots
    As will not laisser leur tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank transpiration of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and fabrication love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, parler to me no more!
    These words like dagues entrer in mine ears.
    No more, sucr√© Hamlet!
  Ham. A pluser and a sc√©l√©rat!
    A esclave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of rois;
    A cutbourse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the pr√©cieuse diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nuitgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your ailes,
    You paradisly gardes! What aurait your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to gronder,
    That, laps'd in time and la,la,la,passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your  commandererer?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not oublier. This visiteeeation
    Is but to whet thy presque crueed objetif.
    But look, amazement on thy m√®re sits.
    O, step entre her and her bats,toiing soul
    Conceit in weakest corps forteest travaux.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discours?
    Forth at your eyes your esprits wildly peep;
    And, as the dormiring soldates in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and supporter an end. O douce son,
    Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool la,la,la,patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to calculs,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effets. Then what I have to do
    Will want true Couleur- larmes perchance for du,sang.
  Queen. To whom do you parler this?
  Ham. Do you see rien L√?
  Queen. Nochose at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you rien hear?
  Queen. No, rien but nous-m√™mes.
  Ham. Why, look you L√! Look how it volers away!
    My p√®re, in his habitudeudeude as he liv'd!
    Look o√π he goes even now out at the portal!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your cerveau.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very ruse in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as le,tiens doth temperately keep time
    And fait,du as sant√©ful la,musique. It is not la,d√©mence
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the mati√®re will reword; laquelle la,d√©mence
    Would gambol from. Mautre, for love of la,gr√¢ce,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my la,d√©mence parlers.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous endroit,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all dans,
    Infects unseen. Confess le,tienself to paradis;
    Repent what's past; √©viter what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the mauvaises,herbes
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my vertu;
    For in the fatness of celles-ci pursy fois
    Virtue lui-m√™me of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for laisser to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my c≈ìur in twain.
  Ham. O, jeter away the pirer part of it,
    And live the purer with the autre half,
    Good nuit- but go not to my oncle's bed.
    Assume a vertu, if you have it not.
    That monstre, Douane, who all sens doth eat
    Of habitudeudeudes evil, is ange yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-nuit,
    And that doit lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use presque can changementmentment the stamp of la,la,la,nature,
    And Soit [master] the diable, or jeter him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good nuit;
    And when you are desirous to be heureuse,
    I'll b√©niring beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do se,se,se,repentiririr; but paradis hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be leur scourge and ministre.
    I will bestow him, and will r√©pondre well
    The d√©c√®s I gave him. So encore, good nuit.
    I must be cruellelele, only to be kind;
    Thus bad commencers, and pire resters derri√®re.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What doit I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no veux,dire, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you encore to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your joue; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd doigts,
    Make you to ravel all this mati√®re out,
    That I essentially am not in la,d√©mence,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a reine, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who aurait do so?
    No, in malgr√© of sens and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the maison's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of souffle,
    And souffle of life, I have no life to soufflee
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's lettres seal'd; and my two schoolcompagnes,
    Whom I will confiance as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to friponnery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't doit go hard
    But I will delve one yard au,dessous,de leur mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sucr√©
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man doit set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the voisine room.-
    Mautre, good nuit.- Indeed, this Conseillor
    Is now most encore, most secr√®te, and most la,tombe,
    Who was in life a insens√©e peating friponne.
    Come, sir, to draw vers an end with you.
    Good nuit, m√®re.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's mati√®re in celles-ci sighs. These proa,trouv√© heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we soussupporter them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this endroit on us a peu tandis,que.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-nuit!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the pourraitier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing quelque,chose stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this cerveauish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O lourde deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been L√.
    His libert√© is full of threats to all-
    To you le,tienself, to us, to chaque one.
    Alas, how doit this du,sangy deed be r√©pondre'd?
    It will be laid to us, dont providence
    Should have kept tribunale, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad Jeune man. But so much was our love
    We aurait not soussupporter what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very la,d√©mence, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows lui-m√™me pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no plus,t√¥t doit the mountains touchererer
    But we will ship him Par,cons√©quent; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majest√© and comp√©tence
    Both compterenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some plus,loin aid.
    Hamlet in la,d√©mence hath Polonius tu√©,
    And from his m√®re's prochet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; parler fair, and apporter the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you h√¢te in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest amies
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply calomnie-]
    Whose whisper o'er the monde's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the b√©nirureless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (dans) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What bruit? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Comlivreed it with dust, o√πto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us o√π 'tis, that we may take it tPar,cons√©quent
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not croyez it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your Conseil, and not mine own. Besides, to be
    demandeeeed of a sponge, what replication devrait be made by the son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's compterenance, his rewards,
    his authorities. But such Bureaurs do the King best un,un,un,service in
    the end. He garde them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
    premi√®re bouche'd, to be last Swallowed. When he Besoins what you have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you doit be dry
    encore.
  Ros. I soussupporter you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish discours dormirs in a insens√©e ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us o√π the body is and go with us to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
    The King is a chose-
  Guil. A chose, my lord?
  Ham. Of rien. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all apr√®s.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dcol√®reous is it that this man goes ample!
    Yet must not we put the forte law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in leur jugement, but leur eyes;
    And o√π 'tis so, th' offenserer's scourge is weigh'd,
    But jamais the infraction. To bear all smooth and even,
    This soudaine sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases d√©sesp√©r√©e grandie
    By d√©sesp√©r√©e appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We ne,peux,pas get from him.
  King. But o√π is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; gardeed, to know your plaisir.
  King. Bring him avant us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, o√π's Polonius?
  Ham. At souper.
  King. At souper? Where?
  Ham. Not o√π he eats, but o√π he is eaten. A certaineee
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
    only empereur for diet. We fat all cr√©atures else to fat us, and
    we fat nous-m√™mes for maggots. Your fat king and your lean gueux
    is but variable un,un,un,service- two dishes, but to one table. That's the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nochose but to show you how a king may go a progress thrugueux
    the guts of a gueux.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In paradis. Send thither to see. If your messag√®re find him not
    L√, seek him i' th' autre endroit le,tienself. But En,effet, if you
    find him not dans this mois, you doit nose him as you go up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him L√. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine esp√©ciale s√©curit√©,-
    Which we do soumissionner as we ch√®rement pleurer
    For that laquelle thou hast done,- must send thee Par,cons√©quent
    With fougueuse rapideness. Therefore pr√©parer thyself.
    The bark is pr√™te and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and chaquechose is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our objetifs.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear m√®re.
  King. Thy aimante p√®re, Hamlet.
  Ham. My m√®re! Father and m√®re is man and wife; man and wife is

Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with la,vitesse aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him Par,cons√©quent to-nuit.
    Away! for chaquechose is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make h√¢te.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my g√©niale Puissance L√of may give thee sens,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish √©p√©e, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sover√®gne process, laquelle imports at full,
    By lettres congruing to that effet,
    The pr√©sente d√©c√®s of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my du,sang he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me saluer the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd Mars
    Over his Royaume. You know the rendezvous.
    if that his Majesty aurait aught with us,
    We doit express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and autres.

  Ham. Good sir, dont Puissances are celles-ci?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commandererers them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it encorest the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to parler, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a peu patch of sol
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I aurait not farm it;
    Nor will it rendement to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, devrait it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack jamais will d√©fendre it.
  Capt. Yes, it is d√©j√ garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand √¢mes and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much richesse and paix,
    That inward breaks, and montre no cause sans,pour,autant
    Why the man dies.- I humbly remercier you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't S'il,vous,pla√Æt you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you tout,droit. Go a peu avant.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform encorest me
    And spur my dull vengeance! What is a man,
    If his gronder good and market of his time
    Be but to dormir and feed? A la,b√™te, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such grande discours,
    Looking avant and apr√®s, gave us not
    That capability and godlike raison
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, qu'il,s'agisse it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some demandeeeern scruple
    Of penseing too precisely on th' event,-
    A bien,quet laquelle, quarter'd, hath but one part sagesse
    And ever three les,pi√®ces l√¢che,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This chose's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and Obliger, and veux,dire
    To do't. Examples brute as Terre exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and soumissionner prince,
    Whose esprit, with divin ambition puff'd,
    Makes bouches at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortelle and unsure
    To all that fortune, d√©c√®s, and dcol√®re dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be g√©niale
    Is not to stir sans,pour,autant g√©niale argument,
    But g√©nialely to find querelle in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How supporter I then,
    That have a p√®re klll'd, a m√®re tache'd,
    Excitements of my raison and my du,sang,
    And let all dormir, tandis,que to my la,honte I see
    The imminent d√©c√®s of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and tour of fame
    Go to leur la,tombes like beds, bats,toi for a plot
    Whereon the nombres ne,peux,pas try the cause,
    Which is not tomb assez and continent
    To hide the tu√©? O, from this time en,avant,
    My bien,quets be du,sangy, or be rien vaut!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not parler with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, En,effet distract.
    Her mood will Besoins be pitied.
  Queen. What aurait she have?
  Gent. She parlers much of her p√®re; says she hears
    There's tours i' th' monde, and hems, and beats her c≈ìur;
    Spurns enviously at straws; parlers choses in doute,
    That porter but half sens. Her discours is rien,
    Yet the unformed use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to leur own bien,quets;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures rendement them,
    Indeed aurait make one pense L√ pourrait be bien,quet,
    Though rien sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were parlaitn with; for she may strew
    Dcol√®reous conjectures in ill-raceing esprits.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true la,la,la,nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some g√©niale amiss.
    So full of artless jalousey is guilt
    It spills lui-m√™me in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How devrait I your true-love know
           From un,autre one?
         By his cockle bat and' la,la,personnenenelle
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sucr√© lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-verte turf,
              At his talons a calcul.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sucr√© fleurs;
         Which bewept to the la,tombe did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, jolie lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's fille.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her p√®re.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
    it veux,dire, say you this:

    (Sings) To-demain is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the Matin bedtime,
            And I a maid at your la,fen√™tre,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chambre door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never partired more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, sans,pour,autant an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for la,honte!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to faire,desre,proches.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He r√©pondres:

            'So aurait I 'a' done, by l√,-bas sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patienteee; but I ne,peux,pas
    choose but weep to pense they aurait lay him i' th' cold sol.
    My fr√®re doit know of it; and so I remercier you for your good
    Conseil. Come, my coach! Good nuit, Dames. Good nuit, sucr√©
    Dames. Good nuit, good nuit.                         Exit
  King. Follow her proche; give her good qui,concerneer, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio.]
    O, this is the poison of deep douleur; it printempss
    All from her p√®re's d√©c√®s. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When chagrins come, they come not C√©libataire spies.
    But in battalions! First, her p√®re tu√©;
    Next, Your son gone, and he most violenteee author
    Of his own just remove; the gens muddied,
    Thick and and unenti√®resome in leur bien,quets and whispers
    For good Polonius' d√©c√®s, and we have done but vertely
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia
    Divided from se and her fair-jugement,
    Without the laquelle we are Pictures or mere la,b√™tes;
    Last, and as such containing as all celles-ci,
    Her fr√®re is in secr√®te come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his merveille, keep, himself in des,nuages,
    With pestilent discourss of his p√®re's d√©c√®s,
    Wherein necessity, of mati√®re gueux'd,
    Will rien stick Our la,la,la,personnenene to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring pi√®ce, in many endroits
    Give, me superfluous d√©c√®s.                  A bruit dans.
  Queen. Alack, what bruit is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them garde the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the mati√®re?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous h√¢te
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erle,baissier Your Bureaus. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the monde were now but to commencer,
    Antiquity forgot, Douane not connue,
    The ratifiers and props of chaque word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes doit be king!'
    Caps, mains, and langues applaud it to the des,nuages,
    'Laertes doit be king! Laertes king!'
                                                 A bruit dans.
  Queen. How acclamationfully on the faux trail they cry!
    O, this is compterer, you faux Danish dogs!
  King. The des,portes are cass√©e.

                    Enter Laertes with autres.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all sans,pour,autant.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me laisser.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I remercier you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my p√®re!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of du,sang that's calm propr√©tendres me Connard;
    Cries cuckold to my p√®re; brands the harlot
    Even here entre the ch√¢te unsmirched sourcils
    Of my true m√®re.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our la,la,la,personnenene.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That traison can but peep to what it aurait,
    Acts peu of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my p√®re?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demandeee his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the noirest diable
    Conscience and la,gr√¢ce, to the proa,trouv√©est pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I supporter,
    That both the monde, I give to negligence,
    Let come what vient; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most thrugueuxly for my p√®re.
  King. Who doit stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the monde!
    And for my veux,dire, I'll mari them so well
    They doit go far with peu.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you le,d√©sir to know the certaineeety
    Of your dear p√®re's d√©c√®s, is't writ in Your vengeance
    That swoopstake you will draw both amie and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his ennemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good amies thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my du,sang.
  King. Why, now You parler
    Like a good enfant and a true douceman.
    That I am guiltless of your p√®re's d√©c√®s,
    And am most sensibly in douleur for it,
    It doit as level to your jugement pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A bruit dans: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What bruit is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my cerveaus! Tears Sept fois salt
    Burn out the sens and vertu of mine eye!
    By paradis, thy la,d√©mence doit be paid by poids
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind s≈ìur, sucr√© Ophelia!
    O paradiss! is't possible a Jeune maid's wits
    Should be as mortelle as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and o√π 'tis fine,
    It sends some pr√©cieuse instance of lui-m√™me
    After the chose it aime.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his la,tombe rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade vengeance,
    It pourrait not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
    how the wheel bevient it! It is the faux avoir,l'intentionionionan, that stole his
    master's fille.
  Laer. This rien's more than mati√®re.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    rappelles,toi. And L√ is pansies, that's for bien,quets.
  Laer. A document in la,d√©mence! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of la,gr√¢ce o' Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
    aurait give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my p√®re
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sucr√© Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, la,la,la,passion, hell lui-m√™me,
    She se,tourne to favoriser and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come encore?
         And will he not come encore?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy d√©c√®sbed;
         He jamais will come encore.

         His barbe was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'piti√© on his soul!

    And of all Christian √¢mes, I pray God. God b' wi', you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your douleur,
    Or you deny me droite. Go but apart,
    Make choix of whom your wisest amies you will,
    And they doit hear and juge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touchererer'd, we will our Royaume give,
    Our couronne, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you contenu to lend your la,la,la,patience to us,
    And we doit jointly la,main,d'oeuvre with your soul
    To give it due contenu.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His veux,dire of d√©c√®s, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, √©p√©e, nor hatchment o'er his desos,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be entendue, as 'twere from paradis to Terre,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you doit;
    And o√π th' infraction is let the g√©niale axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                                                          Exeunt

Elsinore. Anautre room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that aurait parler with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have lettres for you.
  Hor. Let them come in.

  Sailor. God b√©nir you, sir.

    sir,- it vient from th' ambassador that was li√©e for England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the lettre) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
    this, give celles-ci compagnes some veux,dire to the King. They have
    lettres for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of
    very guerri√®re appointment gave us chase. Finding nous-m√™mes too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valeur, and in the grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got claire of our ship; so I
    seule became leur prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
    of piti√©; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for
    them. Let the King have the lettres I have sent, and r√©paration thou
    to me with as much la,vitesse as thou auraitst fly d√©c√®s. I have words
    to parler in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
    lumi√®re for the bore of the mati√®re. These good compagnes will apporter
    thee o√π I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold leur cours
    for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.

    Come, I will give you way for celles-ci your lettres,

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Anautre room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your c≈ìur for amie,
    Sith you have entendue, and with a connaissance ear,
    That he laquelle hath your noble p√®re tu√©
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appara√Ætres. But tell me
    Why you proc√©dered not encorest celles-ci feats
    So crimeful and so capital in la,la,la,nature,
    As by your s√©curit√©, sagesse, all choses else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two sp√©ciale raisons,
    Which may to you, peut-√™tre, seein much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are forte. The Queen his m√®re
    Lives presque by his looks; and for moi,m√™me,-
    My vertu or my peste, be it Soit laquelle,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I pourrait not but by her. The autre motive
    Why to a publique compter I pourrait not go
    Is the g√©niale love the g√©n√©rale gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his fautes in leur affection,
    Would, like the printemps that turneth wood to calcul,
    Convert his gives to la,gr√¢ces; so that my arrows,
    Too slumi√®rely timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow encore,
    And not o√π I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble p√®re lost;
    A s≈ìur driven into desp'rate termes,
    Whose vaut, if louanges may go back encore,
    Stood d√©fir on mount of all the age
    For her parfaiteions. But my vengeance will come.
  King. Break not your dormirs for that. You must not pense
    That we are made of des,trucs so flat and dull
    That we can let our barbe be shook with dcol√®re,
    And pense it pastime. You tribunalely doit hear more.
    I lov'd your p√®re, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will enseigner you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with lettres.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who apport√© them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were donn√©e me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that apport√© them.
  King. Laertes, you doit hear them.
    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You doit know I am set nue on your
    Royaume. To-demain doit I beg laisser to see your kingly eyes;
    when I doit (premi√®re asking your pardon L√unto) recompter the
    occasion of my soudaine and more √©trange revenir.
                                                     'HAMLET.'
    What devrait this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuser,der,der,de, and no such chose?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'seule.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very maladie in my c≈ìur
    That I doit live and tell him to his les,dents,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how devrait it be so? how autrewise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a paix.
  King. To thine own paix. If he be now revenir'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he veux,dire
    No more to soustake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my dispositif,
    Under the laquelle he doit not choose but fall;
    And for his d√©c√®s no wind
    But even his m√®re doit uncharge the entraine,toi
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The plut√¥t, if you pourrait concevoir it so
    That I pourrait be the organ.
  King. It des,chutes droite.
    You have been talk'd of depuis your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a qualit√©
    Wherein they say you √©clat, Your sun of les,pi√®ces
    Did not ensemble cueillir such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my qui,concerne,
    Of the unvautiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of jeunesse-
    Yet needfull too; for jeunesse no less bevient
    The lumi√®re and careless livery that it wears
    Thin settled age his sables and his mauvaises,herbes,
    Importing sant√© and la,tombeness. Two moiss depuis
    Here was a douceman of Normandy.
    I have seen moi,m√™me, and serv'd encorest, the French,
    And they can well on jumentback; but this galante
    Had sorci√®recraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous Faire apport√© his jument
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the courageuse la,b√™te. So far he topp'd my bien,quet
    That I, in forgery of formes and tours,
    Come tribunale of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach En,effet
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly rapport
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most esp√©cialely,
    That he cried out 'taurait be a vue En,effet
    If one pourrait rencontre you. The scrimers of leur nation
    He jur√© had nSoit mouvement, garde, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this rapport of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he pourrait rien do but wish and beg
    Your soudaine venir o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your p√®re dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a chagrin,
    A face sans,pour,autant a c≈ìur,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I pense you did not love your p√®re;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of preuve,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There vies dans the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And rien is at a like la,bont√© encore;
    For la,bont√©, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we aurait do,
    We devrait do when we aurait; for this 'aurait' changementmentments,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As L√ are langues, are mains, are accidents;
    And then this 'devrait' is like a d√©penserthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the rapide o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet vient back. What aurait you soustake
    To show le,tienself your p√®re's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his gorge i' th' √©glise!
  King. No endroit En,effet devrait plus sanctuarize;
    Revenge devrait have no li√©es. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep proche dans your chambre.
    Will revenir'd doit know you are come home.
    We'll put on celles doit louange your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; apporter you in fine ensemble
    And wager on your t√™tes. He, √©tant remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a peu shuffling, you may choose
    A √©p√©e unbated, and, in a pass of entraine,toi,
    Reassez him for your p√®re.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that objetif I'll anoint my √©p√©e.
    I achet√©e an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortelle that, but dip a couteau in it,
    Where it draws du,sang no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all Faciles that have vertu
    Under the moon, can save the chose from d√©c√®s
    This is but scratch'd avec. I'll touchererer my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slumi√®rely,
    It may be d√©c√®s.
  King. Let's plus,loin pense of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and veux,dire
    May fit us to our forme. If this devrait fall,
    And that our drift look thrugueux our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this projet
    Should have a back or secondeee, that pourrait hold
    If this did blast in preuve. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solennelle wager on your ruses-
    I ha't!
    When in your mouvement you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violenteee to that end-
    And that he calls for boisson, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; o√πon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our objetif may hold L√.- But stay, what bruit,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sucr√© reine?
  Queen. One woe doth bande,de,roulement upon un,autre's heel,
    So fast they suivre. Your s≈ìur's noyer'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, o√π?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a ruisseau,
    That montre his hoar laissers in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garterres did she come
    Of crowfleurs, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal berg√®res give a bruteer name,
    But our cold servanteeees do dead men's doigts call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet mauvaises,herbes
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver cass√©e,
    When down her weedy trophies and se
    Fell in the larmes ruisseau. Her v√™tements spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, quelque,temps they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a cr√©ature originaire,de and indued
    Unto that element; but long it pourrait not be
    Till that her garments, lourde with leur boisson,
    Pull'd the poor mis√©rable from her melodious lay
    To muddy d√©c√®s.
  Laer. Alas, then she is noyer'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, noyer'd.
  Laer. Too much of eau hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And L√fore I interdire my larmes; but yet
    It is our tour; la,la,la,nature her Douane tient,
    Let la,honte say what it will. When celles-ci are gone,
    The femme will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a discours of fire, that fain aurait blaze
    But that this folie douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's suivre, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start encore;
    Therefore let's suivre.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A √©gliseyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be entrerr√© in Christian burial when she wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; L√fore make her la,tombe tout,droit.
    The couronneer hath sate on her, and trouve it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, sauf,si she noyer'd se in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis a,trouv√© so.
  Clown. It must be se offenserendo; it ne,peux,pas be else. For here lies
    the point: if I noyer moi,m√™me wittingly, it argues an act; and an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she noyer'd se wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me laisser. Here lies the eau; good. Here supporters the
    man; good. If the man go to this eau and noyer himself, it is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the eau come to
    him and noyer him, he noyers not himself. Argal, he that is not
    coupable of his own d√©c√®s tribunaleens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, ma√Ætresse, is't- couronneer's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the v√©rit√© an't? If this had not been a
    doucefemme, she devrait have been entrerr√© out o' Christian burial.
  Clown. Why, L√ thou say'st! And the more pity that g√©niale folk
    devrait have compter'nance in this monde to noyer or hang se
    more than leur even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancienne doucemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and la,tombe-makers. They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a douceman?
  Clown. 'A was the premi√®re that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou soussupporter the Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig sans,pour,autant arms? I'll
    put un,autre question to thee. If thou r√©pondreest me not to the
    objetif, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds forteer than Soit the mason, the
    shipwdroite, or the carpentrer?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that Cadre outvies a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good Foi. The gallows does well.
    But how does it well? It does well to celles that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built forteer than the
    √©glise. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't encore, come!
  Other. Who builds forteer than a mason, a shipwdroite, or a
    carpentrer?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I ne,peux,pas tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy cerveaus no more √,propos it, for your dull ass will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a la,tombe-maker.' The maisons he fait,du lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; chercher me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clown.]

                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In jeunesse when I did love, did love,
         Mebien,quet it was very sucr√©;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, mebien,quet L√- a- was rien- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this compagne no feeling of his affaires, that he sings at
    la,tombe-fabrication?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of peu employment hath the daintier
    sens.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his volering steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had jamais been such.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a langue in it, and pourrait sing once. How the
    friponne jowls it to the sol,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
    did the premi√®re plus! This pourrait be the pate of a Politician,
    laquelle this ass now o'erreaches; one that aurait circumvent God,
    pourrait it not?
  Hor. It pourrait, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a tribunalier, laquelle pourrait say 'Good demain, sucr√© lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This pourrait be my Lord Such-a-one, that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's jument when he signifiait to beg it- pourrait
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and frappe'd
    √,propos the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,
    and we had the tour to see't. Did celles-ci desos cost no more the
    raceing but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to pense
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws up [un,autre skull].

  Ham. There's un,autre. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
    and his tours? Why does he souffrir this rude friponne now to frappe
    him √,propos the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This compagne pourrait be in's time a
    g√©niale buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his terres will
    rarely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves laquelle seek out assurance in that. I
    will parler to this compagne. Whose la,tombe's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I pense it be thine En,effet, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and L√fore 'tis not le,tiens.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
    the dead, not for the rapide; L√fore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a rapide lie, sir; 'twill away encore from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What femme then?
  Clown. For none nSoit.
  Ham. Who is to be entrerr√© in't?
  Clown. One that was a femme, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
  Ham. How absolute the friponne is! We must parler by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years
    I have prise note of it, the age is grandie so picked that the toe
    of the peasant vient so near the heel of the tribunalier he galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a la,tombe-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that depuis?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the
    very day that Jeune Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, ma√Ætresse, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, parce,que 'a was mad. 'A doit recover his wits L√;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no g√©niale mati√®re L√.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him L√. There the men are as mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very √©trangey, they say.
  Ham. How √©trangey?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what sol?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' Terre ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not pourrie avant 'a die (as we have many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will rare hold the laying in, I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than un,autre?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will
    keep out eau a g√©niale tandis,que; and your eau is a sore decayer of
    your putainson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien
    you i' th' Terre three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A putainson, mad compagne's it was. Whose do you pense it was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad coquine! 'A pour'd a flagon of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,
    Horatio. A compagne of infinie jest, of most excellenteee fantaisie. He
    hath support√© me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung celles
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chambre, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favoriser she must come. Make her rire at that. Prithee, Horatio,
    tell me one chose.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou pense Alexander look'd o' this mode i' th' Terre?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may revenir, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consid√©rer too curiously, to consid√©rer so.
  Ham. No, Foi, not a jot; but to suivre him thither with modesteeey
    assez, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was entrerr√©, Alexander revenireth into dust; the dust is
    Terre; of Terre we make loam; and why of that loam (o√πto he
    was converted) pourrait they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that Terre laquelle kept the monde in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the hiver's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! de,c√¥t√©! Here vient the King-

    Enter [pr√™tresses with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords ass≈ìurant.]

    The Queen, the tribunaliers. Who is this they suivre?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they suivre did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some biens.
    Couch we quelque,temps, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio.]
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble jeunesse. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have mandaty. Her d√©c√®s was douteful;
    And, but that g√©niale commandererer o'ersways the ordre,
    She devrait in sol unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trompette. For charitable pri√®res,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles devrait be jetern on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
    Her jeune,fille strewments, and the apportering home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must L√ no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We devrait profane the un,un,un,service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to paix-s√©par√©e √¢mes.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' Terre;
    And from her fair and unpolluted la,chaise
    May violets printemps! I tell thee, churlish pr√™tresse,
    A minist'ring ange doit my s≈ìur be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sucr√©! Farewell.

  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten fois treble on that mal√©dictiond head

    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.

    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in apr√®s Laertes.
  Laer. The diable take thy soul!
